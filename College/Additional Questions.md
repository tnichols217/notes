## Identity
### Cultural Background
1. Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below. (150 words)

> [!para]
> I was born in Malaysia and have lived here my whole life. Born of an American and a Malaysian, I appear to be fairly American. Attending an International School exposes me to a wide variety of cultures, instilling a fairly sporadic combination of international cultures in me. I enjoy getting to know people of different cultures and frequently get to through various mission trips both within and outside of Malaysia.

### Anything Else?
1. If there is anything we should know about your school's grading system or course offerings (including disruptions due to COVID-19), please use the space below. (250 words)

> [!para]
> In my current High School, it was exceptionally difficult for me to take certain AP classes there exists a strict policy on prerequisites and how many free blocks you must take. For example, I was originally not allowed to take AP Biology as I never officially completed the course, although I did audit and pass the course the year prior. The class would not be considered as an official course as it fell during my mandatory free block. Another issue was that I was not allowed to submit my AP 3-D art portfolio after one year of the class. Normally, this AP would span two years (four semesters), but I had completed all the pieces after the second semester. The school would not allow me to submit my artwork without taking an additional two semesters of the course, which would have reduced my available time for other courses.
> 
> During COVID-19, Malaysia declared a state of emergency and restricted the movement of citizens, this prevented students like me from attending physical school for roughly one year. Online school was plagued by a multitude of issues, including using a non-standard schedule for classes and not being able to use laboratory equipment. AP testing during this time was online and conducted at the same time across the whole globe, meaning my AP tests were at 3 in the morning. Issues like this throughout the year were very disorienting and tiresome to deal with.

### Writing Questions
1. Briefly elaborate on an activity, organisation, work experience, or hobby that has been particularly meaningful to you. (150 words)

> [!para]
> I have been coding for a fairly long time, but only recently been interested in joining the Open Source community. Soon after that, I began my first open source project that I am truly proud of: obsidian-columns. Coding as a hobby and now trying to contribute to the Open Source community is meaningful to me as it not only gives me a new perspective on how to code and collaborate with others, but also how to manage and communicate with the end users. It has also allowed me to explore more specifics in the field of Computer Science to figure out which areas I'm more interested in.

2. At Princeton, we value diverse perspectives and the ability to have respectful dialogue about difficult issues. Share a time when you had a conversation with a person or a group of people about a difficult topic. What insight did you gain, and how would you incorporate that knowledge into your thinking in the future?* (250 words)

> [!para]
> I once was having a conversation with a few friends on how different people use computers differently. We covered topics such as privacy, accessibility, design vs. function, and productivity/efficiency. Although all of us were programmers on some level, we all viewed computers different even with respect to software development. Me, leaning more to the side of believing that privacy is important to respect, customisation and fine tuning are important for increasing productivity, and function should always come first before form disagreed often with a friend who believed that privacy should be given up for convenience, customisation is not important for the end-user, and that design is key to good function. This really opened my eyes to seeing no matter how similar we were in what we were aiming to do, our methods of getting there and our mentalities along the way were vastly different. I learned that not everyone cares about optimising their workflow for themselves and that often designing something that has visual appeal and simplicity appeals to most people rather than a complicated more powerful alternative. I can apply this to anything I create, now that I understand that people have vastly different workflows for accomplishing similar tasks.

3. Princeton has a longstanding commitment to service and civic engagement. Tell us how your story intersects (or will intersect) with these ideals.* (250 words)

> [!para]
> Throughout my High School Career, I spend a lot of time volunteering in the community. In Boy Scouts, I participated in close to all the available service projects even if I had already completed my required hours. I contribute to my community multiple times a week outside of scouts: a weekly trash pickup for a couple hours, volunteering at my church, and even to the mainland to volunteer in refugee schools for teaching.
> 
> I would like to be able to serve more and with more people. I love to be able to serve people and Princeton's service culture will only enable me further in my service, not only through encouraging service itself, but by also providing a community centred around service. Reflexively, my love for service will contribute to the service community at Princeton as well.

4. What is a new skill you would like to learn in college? (50 words)

> [!para]
> Although I have been able to learn to collaborate in Open Source development recently, I would love to be able to learn how to function as part of a team especially in the context of software development as there is not much of a CS community where I'm from.

5. What brings you joy?* (50 words)

> [!para]
> Being able to serve and benefit other people brings me joy. For example, when I went on a mission trip to Perak to the indigenous to help teach them English and coding, it brought me joy because I felt like I made a difference and bettered other people.

6. What song represents the soundtrack of your life at this moment?* (50 words)

> [!para]
> 100 Bad Days by AJR
> 
> The song talks about bad things in the past can be seen in a good light no matter what. Even though life is stressful for me at the moment, I know that no matter what I can look at it in a positive light.

(200 words)

> [!para]
> Being able to serve others is a really important part of my life. Recently I got to go on a mission trip to the indigenous in Perak. Whilst I was serving there, teaching English and some basic coding, I learned that the people there were happy with whatever you gave them. Getting to know them and see how they live and how they view the world deeply impacted my own perspective. They taught me how important a community is to living not only a satisfying but also an effective life. They've taught me how important it is for me myself to contribute to the community in a beneficial manner. Columbia's community around Computer Science will have a similar impact on me, one that will challenge what I already believe in a positive environment. I too, will bring an encouraging nature and positive lookout, knowing how important it is for a community to thrive.

> [!para]
> I have always been interested in running my own company, from managing the finances, inventory, and time to marketing and interacting with customers. Two years ago, my school began a pilot program for an entrepreneurship club. I joined as soon as I could as I thought it would be a valuable learning experience which would benefit me in the long run. I started a small bagel company by the name of Bagelbyte, a blend of my product and my hobbies: programming and computers. As much as I loved being able to try and automate as much of the business as I could, treating it more like a complicated CI/CD setup, I wish I could learn more about the entrepreneurship sector in my future ventures. I believe that Columbia will facilitate and encourage my next computer science research related ventures. The multitude of programs offered at Columbia draw me in to believing that this is where I will truly be able to explore, research, and grow my interests in both computer science and entrepreneurship.

# Yale University
## QB Supplement
1. Tell us about a topic or idea that excites you and is related to one or more academic areas you selected above. Why are you drawn to it? (200 words)

> [!para]
> Seeing any kind of software infrastructure integration really interests me. Ever since I started learning about CI/CD I was blown away by the possibilities and how easy it was to streamline the entire code pipeline. Recently I learned about Nix, a functional programming language and package manager, which allows you to more easily compile bit-perfect reproducible results. Synergetically, it allows you to guarantee that your CI/CD pipeline will behave deterministically without having to develop in the same environment.
> 
> As I was first exploring Nix and its functional, declarative nature, I was deeply intrigued by having things perfectly reproducible and repeatable, down to the level of an entire operating system (NixOS). Even with its frustrations, the idea of having your code compile deterministically and "perfectly" every time is deeply satisfying. I am drawn to reproducible environments as it allows people to spend more time actually developing rather than trying to understand why my code doesn't work for you when it runs perfect for me. All this goes to say that software infrastructure interests me; all the dependencies, build system, and CI/CD complexly collaborating together to produce a meaningful and unique result still manages to blow my mind.

2. What is it about Yale that has led you to apply? (125 words)

> [!para]
> Yale's community centered around both acceptance and and excellence has driven me to want to be a part of Yale. Having a culture of inclusivity removes the discomfort I get from migrating to a completely novel culture and location. Yale's strong dedication to academics including within the Computer Science field and its pristine reputation for quality courses both implore me to learn at Yale.

> Four years ago, I was at a New Year's party with no one I knew as I had followed my parents and sister to their friend's house. It got boring really quick and I wanted to go home as soon as possible because I had no one to talk to, but later a group of older kids invited me over to talk with me and play Foosball.
> 
> Thank you so much for simply talking to me. Even if it may seem like nothing in the moment, you lightened up my day and turned what was to me a boring party into one that I didn't want to leave. Although it has been four years now and I still don't know your names or how to contact you, that simple interaction has stuck with me since then. You taught me how to look out for other people even it isn't the most convenient. I now understand that a little effort into trying to lighten someone else's day has an exponential output on that person's life. Thank you for not only making my day, but for teaching me a valuable lesson on how to care.
