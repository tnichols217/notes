## Identity
### Cultural Background
1. Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below. (150 words)

> [!para]
> Born to an American father and Malaysian mother, I have grown up understanding and balancing different cultures. My parents teach in a non-profit American international school in Malaysia where I am privileged to attend along with peers from over 25 nations. I have learned that unity and harmony exist from understanding and not tolerance. Tolerance suggests enduring or putting up with while understanding implies that there is nothing to “endure” and that existing in harmony within a community of different beliefs and practices is possible. Once, the school rolled out a personality test that groups personalities by colors. That made me understand why some “blue” teachers can spend a whole block talking about feelings, and why my “green” principle is so goal oriented and unapproachable. It doesn’t mean that the blue teacher is not focused on academics or the green principle is not caring. I see culture the same way, if I understand the “personalities” of culture, there is no real conflict.

2. Please tell us if aspects of your identity have been a barrier to educational access and opportunity. (150 words)

> [!para]
> I have been very privileged and grateful to have what I have. A school that my family would not have been able to afford if not for my parents working there. A geographical location where I can experience different cultures and serve. My school/environment is one that champions equality and kindness. When I perform exceptionally better than my classmates, it must be kept quiet as to not upset my other classmates and therefore discourages them. Awards should be given to the seniors in my class as I am often the youngest, having skipped a grade, or several grades in some classes. Awards are also often given to the most improved and not to the ones that excel from the very beginning.  While I agree that we should be kind and encouraging, I believe that acknowledging and encouraging the ones who excel is equally important.

### Anything Else?
1. If there is anything we should know about your school's grading system or course offerings (including disruptions due to COVID-19), please use the space below. (250 words)

> [!para]
> My school has a strict policy on APs. A Junior is allowed to take 2APs with one study hall and exceptional students can take 3APs with 2 study halls while fulfilling compulsory subjects like Bible and English. This policy has limited my desire to take more challenging courses. I have an immense craving to learn new things and to be challenged; my Biology teacher, recognizing this, allowed me to audit her class during my study hall. I gratefully did all required class work, quizzes, test and made notes for the whole class, fully acknowledging that credit is not given for this class. However, when the school counselor found out, I was reprimanded severely and was threatened with a bad recommendation letter. I was prohibited from taking AP Biology the following year, my parents were called in and I was accused of manipulating the system because I wanted to learn during a study hall. In my senior year, the school started a “Gifted” program that solved some of these problems. Therefore, it is my dream to be accepted into MIT where hungry minds are fed and not made guilty. A place where excellence is encouraged and expected, where peers are equally driven and excited about learning.
> 
> Malaysia has strict lockdowns during COVID-19, allowing students to be in school for just a few weeks in the 2 year duration. Sports and all extra-curricular activities were not allowed. AP testing during this time was online and conducted at 3am in Malaysia.

## Academics
1. Have you had any extenuating circumstances regarding your coursework (such as limited course selection or disruptions) not described elsewhere in your application?  If so, tell us about them here. (150 words)

> [!para]
> In my current High School, it was exceptionally difficult for me to take certain AP classes there exists a strict policy on prerequisites and how many free blocks you must take. For example, I was originally not allowed to take AP Biology as I never officially completed the course, although I did audit and pass the course the year prior. The class would not be considered as an official course as it fell during my mandatory free block. Another issue was that I was not allowed to submit my AP 3-D art portfolio after one year of the class. Normally, this AP would span two years (four semesters), but I had completed all the pieces after the second semester. The school would not allow me to submit my artwork without taking an additional two semesters of the course, which would have reduced my available time for other courses.

2. Some Caltech applicants engage in STEM competitions locally, nationally, and internationally (such as AIME, Science Olympiad, International Science Olympiads).  If you have received any STEM honors or awards, list them here (and scores, if applicable). (200 words)

### Writing Questions
1. Briefly elaborate on an activity, organisation, work experience, or hobby that has been particularly meaningful to you. (150 words)

> [!para]
> I have been coding for a fairly long time, but only recently been interested in joining the Open Source community. Soon after that, I began my first open source project that I am truly proud of: obsidian-columns. Coding as a hobby and now trying to contribute to the Open Source community is meaningful to me as it not only gives me a new perspective on how to code and collaborate with others, but also how to manage and communicate with the end users. It has also allowed me to explore more specifics in the field of Computer Science to figure out which areas I'm more interested in.

2. At Princeton, we value diverse perspectives and the ability to have respectful dialogue about difficult issues. Share a time when you had a conversation with a person or a group of people about a difficult topic. What insight did you gain, and how would you incorporate that knowledge into your thinking in the future?* (250 words)

> [!para]
> I once was having a conversation with a few friends on how different people use computers differently. We covered topics such as privacy, accessibility, design vs. function, and productivity/efficiency. Although all of us were programmers on some level, we all viewed computers different even with respect to software development. Me, leaning more to the side of believing that privacy is important to respect, customisation and fine tuning are important for increasing productivity, and function should always come first before form disagreed often with a friend who believed that privacy should be given up for convenience, customisation is not important for the end-user, and that design is key to good function. This really opened my eyes to seeing no matter how similar we were in what we were aiming to do, our methods of getting there and our mentalities along the way were vastly different. I learned that not everyone cares about optimising their workflow for themselves and that often designing something that has visual appeal and simplicity appeals to most people rather than a complicated more powerful alternative. I can apply this to anything I create, now that I understand that people have vastly different workflows for accomplishing similar tasks.

3. Princeton has a longstanding commitment to service and civic engagement. Tell us how your story intersects (or will intersect) with these ideals.* (250 words)

> [!para]
> From a young age, my parents instilled in me the importance of service and giving back. We have traveled into some politically dangerous parts of the mountainous jungle to live and serve with the indigenous people. We cooked, built, teach, clean, and build relationships with them. During COVID-19, old folks homes and orphanages were in short of food and supplies. We would cook and bake for these homes. Last summer, I spent my holidays volunteering at Rohingha schools. Rohinghas are stateless people who had to flee their country, Myanmar, because of their Muslim religion. They are not recognized in Malaysia and do not have access to jobs, education or healthcare. Some make-shift schools are established but they are in poor conditions. I taught English, Math, Science, and even some crafts to the children ages from 5-19 years old. Service and civic engagement is ingrained in my being: at school, I am committed to peer tutoring, being a teacher’s assistant, and developing a digital inventory management system for the Science labs. Weekly, I volunteer for trash pick-up, sound management and all technical needs e.g. live streaming and data management at church. When I started my own business of selling bagels, I made sure a portion goes to charity. I live in a community, and it is only natural to serve the people and the environment around me. I am impressed that Princeton places an importance on service and I am excited if given the opportunity to serve with you.

4. What is a new skill you would like to learn in college? (50 words)

> [!para]
> Born to an American father and Malaysian mother, I have grown up understanding and balancing different cultures. My parents teach in a non-profit American international school in Malaysia where I am privileged to attend along with peers from over 25 nations. On a broader scope, I live in a multicultural country that is made up of three predominant ethnicities. Living in this environment, I learned that unity and harmony exist from understanding and not tolerance. Tolerance suggests enduring or "putting up with" while understanding implies that there is nothing to “endure”, and that existing in harmony within a community of different beliefs and practices is one out of respect and acceptance. Once, my school rolled out a personality test that groups personalities by colors. That made me understand why some “blue” teachers can spend a whole block talking about feelings when something tragic happened, and why my “green” principle is so goal oriented. It doesn’t mean that the “blue” teacher is not focused on academics, or the “green” principle is uncaring, they just have different personalities. I see culture the same way, if I understand the “personalities” of culture, acceptance of each other’s beliefs and practices becomes natural. 

> [!para]
> Being able to serve others is a really important part of my life. Recently I got to go on a mission trip to the indigenous in Perak. Whilst I was serving there, teaching English and some basic coding, I learned that the people there were happy with whatever you gave them. Getting to know them and see how they live and how they view the world deeply impacted my own perspective. They taught me how important a community is to living not only a satisfying but also an effective life. They've taught me how important it is for me myself to contribute to the community in a beneficial manner. Columbia's community around Computer Science will have a similar impact on me, one that will challenge what I already believe in a positive environment. I too, will bring an encouraging nature and positive lookout, knowing how important it is for a community to thrive.

4. Why are you interested in attending Columbia University? We encourage you to consider the aspect(s) that you find unique and compelling about Columbia. (200 words)

> [!para]
> My art teacher said, anyone can learn to be a good painter but not every good painter is an artist. I chose Columbia not because I want to only be the best coder, engineer, or 3D designer, but because I want to be a successful innovator and entrepreneur. Columbia understands the importance of innovation and provides invaluable resources: expert mentorships, unique R&D resources, and state-of-the-art facilities. This environment will assist and propel me towards fulfilling my dream of innovating. I am equally excited to see that Columbia places an importance in sustainability and climate control. Having spent much time in the jungles and with the indigenous people, I understand how alarming the issues of sustainability and climate is. I have a penchant for computer science (best student award) and have been tinkering with engineering since young. I have an eye for design and completed AP Art 3D Design. I am very proficient using Blender for 3D rendering (3 unsolicited internship offers). I have served in rainforests and mountainous jungles and therefore understand the needs of the environment. But most of all, I have the passion to invent, innovate, create for the environment. Allow me to be the artist and not just a good painter.

> [!para]
> Seeing any kind of software infrastructure integration really interests me. Ever since I started learning about CI/CD I was blown away by the possibilities and how easy it was to streamline the entire code pipeline. Recently I learned about Nix, a functional programming language and package manager, which allows you to more easily compile bit-perfect reproducible results. Synergetically, it allows you to guarantee that your CI/CD pipeline will behave deterministically without having to develop in the same environment.
> 
> As I was first exploring Nix and its functional, declarative nature, I was deeply intrigued by having things perfectly reproducible and repeatable, down to the level of an entire operating system (NixOS). Even with its frustrations, the idea of having your code compile deterministically and "perfectly" every time is deeply satisfying. I am drawn to reproducible environments as it allows people to spend more time actually developing rather than trying to understand why my code doesn't work for you when it runs perfect for me. All this goes to say that software infrastructure interests me; all the dependencies, build system, and CI/CD complexly collaborating together to produce a meaningful and unique result still manages to blow my mind.
