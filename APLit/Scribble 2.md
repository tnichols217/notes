# The pinkening
> [!para]
> On the night of the 21st of May, 2023, the entire Dalat High School was turned upside down as the Senior Prank underwent. As the academic year was nearing its end, the Seniors took one last effort to leave their mark on the school before their departure.
> 
> Around 8:00 PM, the experiment began: seniors completely inconspicuously began filing onto school grounds, gathering in clumps much like little bacterial colonies on an agar plate.
> 
> T+ 10 minutes these aggressive colonies began infecting the school ground 


Chris Jang: "I was hoping for our prank to be more like the previous class's who's rubber duckies we still see around today. But maybe not as polluting."

"We could've had more pink. Sorry, we should've had more pink."

David Kim: "It was very pink."

Moriah Winsor: "Not advised for globophiobics."
