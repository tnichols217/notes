It was close to ten o’clock in the evening, more than forty hours since we had found the victim.
Corwi drove—she made no effort to disguise her uniform, despite that we had an unmarked car
through the streets around GunterStrász. I had not been home until very late the previous night,
and after a morning on my own in these same streets now I was there again. 
There were places of crosshatch in the larger streets and a few elsewhere, but that far out the
bulk of the area was total. Few antique Besź stylings, few steep roofs or many-paned windows:
these were hobbled factories and warehouses. A handful of decades old, often broken-glassed,
at half capacity if open. Boarded facades. Grocery shops fronted with wire. Older fronts in
tumbledown of classical Besź 
style. Some houses colonised and made chapels and drug houses: some burnt out and left as
crude carbon renditions of themselves. 
The area was not crowded, but it was far from empty. Those who were out looked like landscape,
like they were always there. There had been fewer that morning but not very markedly. 
“Did you see Shukman working on the body?” 
“No.” I was looking at what we passed, referring to my map. “I got there after he was done.” 
“Squeamish?” she said. 
“No.” 
“Wel ...” She smiled and turned the car. “You’d have to say that even if you were.” 
“True,” I said, though it was not. 
She pointed out what passed for landmarks. I did not tel her I had been in Kordvenna early in the
day, sounding these places. 
Corwi did not try to disguise her police clothes because that way those who saw us, who might
otherwise think we were there to entrap them, would know that was not our intent; and the fact
that we were not in a bruise, as we caled the black-and-blue police cars, told them that neither
were we there to harass them. Intricate contracts! 
Most of those around us were in Besźel so we saw them. Poverty deshaped the already staid,
drab cuts and colours that enduringly characterise Besź clothes—what has been caled the city’s
fashionless fashion. Of the exceptions, some we realised when we glanced were elsewhere, so
unsaw, but the younger Besź were also more colourful, their clothes more pictured, than their
parents.
