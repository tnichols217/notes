Palestinian American literary theorist and cultural critic Edward Said has written that “Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted.” Yet Said has also said that exile can become “a potent, even enriching” experience.  
Select a novel, play, or epic (Things Fall Apart) in which a character experiences such a rift and becomes cut off from “home,” whether that home is the character’s birthplace, family, homeland, or other special place. Then write an essay in which you analyze how the character’s experience with exile is both alienating and enriching, and how this experience illuminates the meaning of the work as a whole.

- 1B. Explain the function of a character changing or remaining unchanged.
- 2C. Describe the relationship between a character and a setting.
- 7B. Develop a thesis statement that conveys a defensible claim about an interpretation of literature and that may establish a line of reasoning.
- 7C. Develop commentary that establishes and explains relationships among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the thesis.
- 7D. Select and use relevant and sufficient evidence to both develop and support a line of reasoning.

> Throughout Things Fall Apart, Nwoye undergoes an alienating yet enriching exile from his father, family, and tradition due to his introduction into the christian community. His initial departure from his father began early in his life when his father noticed that Nwoye is not and will not be as masculine as he was. Ultimately, the rift led Nwoye to leave his own culture for that of the Christians, followed by an expected disowning by his father. Nwoye's exile is not all mobid, however, as he finally experiences acceptance into a community unlike the hostility of his family.

> Towards the beginning of the book, Nwoye and his father already had a shaky relationship. Exemplified early in the story, Nwoye is shown to already not have the favor of his father: "So Okonkwo encouraged the boys to sit with him in him obi, and he told them stories of the land -- masculine stories of violence and bloodshed. Nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories that his mother used to tell..." (24.5%). Okonkwo, being effected by his own relationship with his father wants to be as masculine as possible and instill that value into his son Nwoye. At this stage, Okonkwo still has hopes of being able to "save"
