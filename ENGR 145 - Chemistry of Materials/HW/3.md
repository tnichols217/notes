In Callister’s book two polymorphs of tin are described. Look up the lattice parameters for each polymorph. Also, determine the number atoms in the unit cell of each polymorph.

> [!answer]
> $\alpha$-tin
> - Diamond Cube
> - $a=6.489Å$
> - Density: $5.77 \frac{g}{cm^3}$
> 
> $\beta$-tin
> - Body Centered Tetragonal
> - $a=5.831Å$
> - $c=3.181Å$
> - Density: $7.29 \frac{g}{cm^3}$

# 2

> If you look at the atom located at the bottom right of the image, moving 1/4 left, 1/4 back and 1/4 up would get you an atom which is directly adjacent to it. Therefore there is an atom at that position.

# 3

Summarize a web article a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) project that involves studying a material with the perovskite crystal structure.

> [!answer]
> The structure of the perovskite crystal allows more light to enter the photovoltaic elements, which increases the efficiency of the panels. This is because the structure itself is thinner.

# 4

The accompanying figure shows a unit cell for a hypothetical metal.

## a

To which crystal system does this unit cell belong?

> [!answer]
> $a=b\not=c$
> $\alpha=\beta=\gamma$
> Tetragonal crystal system

## b

What would this crystal structure be called?

> [!answer]
> Body centered Tetragonal

## c

Calculate the density of the material, given that its atomic weight is 141 g/mol.

> [!answer]
> $\rho=\frac{nA}{V_cN_A}$

# 5
