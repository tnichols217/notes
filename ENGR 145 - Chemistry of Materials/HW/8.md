To provide some perspective on the dimensions of atomic defects, consider a metal specimen that has a dislocation density of $10^4~ mm^{-2}$. Suppose that all the dislocations in $1000~ mm^3$ were somehow removed and linked end to end. How far (in miles) would this chain extend? Now suppose that the density is increased to $10^{10}~ mm^{âˆ’2}$ by cold working. What would be the chain length of dislocations in $1000~ mm^3$ of material?

Consider two edge dislocations of opposite sign and having slip planes that are separated by several atomic distances as indicated in the following diagram. Briefly describe the defect that results when these two dislocations become aligned with each other.
