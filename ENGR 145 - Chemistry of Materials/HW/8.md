To provide some perspective on the dimensions of atomic defects, consider a metal specimen that has a dislocation density of $10^4~ mm^{-2}$. Suppose that all the dislocations in $1000~ mm^3$ were somehow removed and linked end to end. How far (in miles) would this chain extend? Now suppose that the density is increased to 1010 mmâˆ’2 by cold working. What would be the chain length of dislocations in 1000 mm3 of material?
