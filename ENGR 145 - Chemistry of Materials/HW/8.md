To provide some perspective on the dimensions of atomic defects, consider a metal specimen that has a dislocation density of $10^4~ mm^{-2}$. Suppose that all the dislocations in $1000~ mm^3$ were somehow removed and linked end to end. How far (in miles) would this chain extend? Now suppose that the density is increased to $10^{10}~ mm^{−2}$ by cold working. What would be the chain length of dislocations in $1000~ mm^3$ of material?
