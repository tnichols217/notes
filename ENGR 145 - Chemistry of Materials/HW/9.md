Using a spreadsheet or a MatLab program, and using the following dataset construct a phase diagram for the silicon-germanium system.

| Composition (wt% Si) | Solidus Temperature (°C) | Liquidus Temperature (°C) |

## b

Compare your diagram to this one published in ‘Littlejohns, Callum G., et al. "Silicon diffusion engineering in rapid melt growth of silicon-germanium on insulator." Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts 226. No. 35. The Electrochemical
Society, Inc., 2014.’

If there are differences of notes describe them.

# 2

Using Fig 10.3, consider a copper–nickel alloy of composition 70 wt% Ni–30 wt% Cu is slowly heated from a temperature of 1300°C (2370°F).

## a

At what temperature does the first liquid phase form?

## b

What is the composition of this liquid phase?

## 
(c) At what temperature does complete melting of the alloy occur?
(d) What is the composition of the last solid remaining prior to complete melting?
