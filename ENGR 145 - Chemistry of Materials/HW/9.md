Using a spreadsheet or a MatLab program, and using the following dataset construct a phase diagram for the silicon-germanium system.

Compare your diagram to this one published in ‘Littlejohns, Callum G., et al. "Silicon diffusion engineering in rapid melt growth of silicon-germanium on insulator." Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts 226. No. 35. The Electrochemical
Society, Inc., 2014.’

If there are differences of notes describe them.

> Their solidus line has a positive curvature whilst the one we graphed does not. The liquidus line looks fairly similar. This is because their scale is non-linear on the weight percentage of silicon.

Using Fig 10.3, consider a copper–nickel alloy of composition 70 wt% Ni–30 wt% Cu is slowly heated from a temperature of 1300°C (2370°F).

## a

At what temperature does the first liquid phase form?

> [!answer]
> 

## b

What is the composition of this liquid phase?

## c

At what temperature does complete melting of the alloy occur?

## d

What is the composition of the last solid remaining prior to complete melting?

# 3

Referring to discussion in the book about Fig 10.14 and 10.15, briefly explain why, upon solidification, an alloy of eutectic composition forms a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of the two solid phases.

# 4

In your own words is the difference between a phase and a microconstituent?

# 5

Consider Gibbs Phase rule and using the diagrams in Chap 10 in the book and specify the number of degrees of freedom for the following alloys:

## a

95 wt% Ag–5 wt% Cu at 780°C

## b

80 wt% Ni–20 wt% Cu at 1400°C

## c

44.9 wt% Ti–55.1 wt% Ni at 1310°C

## d

61.9 wt% Sn–38.1 wt% Pb at 183°C

## e

2.5 wt% C–97.5 wt% Fe at 1000°C
