Using a spreadsheet or a MatLab program, and using the following dataset construct a phase diagram for the silicon-germanium system.

| Composition (wt% Si) | Solidus Temperature (°C) | Liquidus Temperature (°C) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |

Compare your diagram to this one published in ‘Littlejohns, Callum G., et al. "Silicon diffusion engineering in rapid melt growth of silicon-germanium on insulator." Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts 226. No. 35. The Electrochemical
Society, Inc., 2014.’

If there are differences of notes describe them.

> [!answer]
> Their solidus line has a positive curvature whilst the one we graphed does not. The liquidus line looks fairly similar. This is because their scale is non-linear on the weight percentage of silicon.

Using Fig 10.3, consider a copper–nickel alloy of composition 70 wt% Ni–30 wt% Cu is slowly heated from a temperature of 1300°C (2370°F).

![[10.3.svg]]

## a

At what temperature does the first liquid phase form?

> [!answer]
> Around 1325°C

## b

What is the composition of this liquid phase?

> [!answer]
> At 1325°C the liquid will be fully consisting of Cu as it has the lower melting point.

## c

At what temperature does complete melting of the alloy occur?

> [!answer]
> Around 1370°C

## d

What is the composition of the last solid remaining prior to complete melting?

> [!answer]
> Mainly Ni, as it has the higher melting point.

# 3

Referring to discussion in the book about Fig 10.14 and 10.15, briefly explain why, upon solidification, an alloy of eutectic composition forms a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of the two solid phases.

> [!answer]
> The diffusion of the different metals at the eutectic point means both metals cool at the same time, solidifying with anything that diffused near to it.

# 4

In your own words is the difference between a phase and a microconstituent?

> [!answer]
> A phase is a portion of the possible states in an alloy that is homogeneous
> A microconstituent is a phase or a mixture of phases that create a unique visual appearance or structue.

# 5

Consider Gibbs Phase rule and using the diagrams in Chap 10 in the book and specify the number of degrees of freedom for the following alloys:

$P+F=C+N$

## a

95 wt% Ag–5 wt% Cu at 780°C

> [!answer]
> $P=1$
> $C=1$
> $N=2$
> $F=2$

## b

80 wt% Ni–20 wt% Cu at 1400°C

> [!answer]
> $P=$

## c

44.9 wt% Ti–55.1 wt% Ni at 1310°C

## d

61.9 wt% Sn–38.1 wt% Pb at 183°C

## e

2.5 wt% C–97.5 wt% Fe at 1000°C
