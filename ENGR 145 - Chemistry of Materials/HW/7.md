# 1

A cylindrical specimen of a titanium alloy having an elastic modulus of 107 GPa (15.5 x 106 psi) and an original diameter of 3.8 mm (0.15 in.) experiences only elastic deformation when a tensile load of 2000 N (450 lbf) is applied. Compute the maximum length of the specimen before deformation if the maximum allowable elongation is 0.42 mm (0.0165 in.).

# 2

A cylindrical specimen of aluminum having a diameter of 0.505 in. (12.8 mm) and a gauge length of 2.000 in. (50.800 mm) is pulled in tension. Use the loadâ€“elongation characteristics shown in the following table to complete parts (a) through (f).

## a

Plot the data as engineering stress versus engineering strain.

## b

Compute the modulus of elasticity.

## c

Determine the yield strength at a strain offset of 0.002.

## d

Determine the tensile strength of this alloy.

## e

What is the approximate ductility, in percent elongation?

## f

Compute the modulus of resilience.

# 3

A cylindrical specimen of a brass alloy 7.5 mm (0.30 in.) in diameter and 90.0 mm (3.54 in.) long is pulled in tension with a force of 6000 N (1350 lbf); the force is subsequently released.
