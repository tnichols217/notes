A cylindrical specimen of a titanium alloy having an elastic modulus of 107 GPa (15.5 x 106 psi) and an original diameter of 3.8 mm (0.15 in.) experiences only elastic deformation when a tensile load of 2000 N (450 lbf) is applied. Compute the maximum length of the specimen before deformation if the maximum allowable elongation is 0.42 mm (0.0165 in.).
