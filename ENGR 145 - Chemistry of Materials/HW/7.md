# 1

A cylindrical specimen of a titanium alloy having an elastic modulus of 107 GPa (15.5 x 106 psi) and an original diameter of 3.8 mm (0.15 in.) experiences only elastic deformation when a tensile load of 2000 N (450 lbf) is applied. Compute the maximum length of the specimen before deformation if the maximum allowable elongation is 0.42 mm (0.0165 in.).

# 2

A cylindrical specimen of aluminum having a diameter of 0.505 in. (12.8 mm) and a gauge length of 2.000 in. (50.800 mm) is pulled in tension. Use the loadâ€“elongation characteristics shown in the following table to complete parts (a) through (f).
