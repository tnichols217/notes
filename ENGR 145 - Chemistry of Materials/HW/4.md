Calculate the number density of atoms in the diamond cubic form of carbon (a literal diamond) and separately calculate the number density of atoms in silicon (which also has the diamond cubic crystal structure). The lattice parameter of diamond is 3.57 Angstroms (or 0.357 nm, or 0.357 x 10-9 m. The laï¿½ce parameter of silicon is 5.43 Angstroms (or 0.543 nm)
