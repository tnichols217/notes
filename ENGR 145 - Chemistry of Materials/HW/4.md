Calculate the number density of atoms in the diamond cubic form of carbon (a literal diamond) and separately calculate the number density of atoms in silicon (which also has the diamond cubic crystal structure). The lattice parameter of diamond is 3.57 Angstroms (or 0.357 nm, or 0.357 x 10-9 m. The la�ce parameter of silicon is 5.43 Angstroms (or 0.543 nm)

Single crystals of sodium iodide (with low levels of thallium as a controlled impurity) are used as scintillation detectors for nuclear medicine. One manufacturer is Luxium Solutions in Hiram Ohio. On the datasheet (posted on Canvas or available at the botom of webpage at https://www.luxiumsolutions.com/radiation-detection-scintillators/crystal-scintillators/naitl-scintilla�on-crystals) you will find that they sell  
single crystals as large as 4”x4”x16”. Look up or calculate (in a manner analogous to  
Example Problem 3.7 in Callister and Rethwisch) the density of sodium iodide. Then,  
calculate and report the mass of these large rectangular blocks.
