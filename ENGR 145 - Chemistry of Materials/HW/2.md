Calculate and compare: the change in thermal energy associated with  eating an atoms from room temperature, $300 K$, to $1500 K$ using the expression

$E_{thermal}=k_bT$

To the energy of a photon with a wavelength of $500 nm$ using the expression

$E_{photon}=\frac{h_{planck}c}{\lambda}$

Where:
- $k_b=1.3806503\times10^{-23}~ \frac{m^2kg}{s^2K}$

If aluminum is heated from room temperature to its melting point (660°C) it expands 1.5%. What is the bond length at room temperature and what is it just below its melting point?

# 3

The book makes the distinction between atomic structure and crystal structure. Briefly explain the difference in your own words.

# 4

The atomic packing factor is defined in the book as “the sum of the sphere volumes of all atoms within a unit cell (assuming the atomic hard-sphere model) divided by the unit cell volume.” How is the radius of the atomic hard-model described in the book.

# 5

Showing all your work, show that the atomic packing factor for body-centered cubic is 68% and for face-centered cubic is 74%.
