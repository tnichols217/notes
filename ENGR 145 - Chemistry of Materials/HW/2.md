Calculate and compare: the change in thermal energy associated with  eating an atoms from room temperature, $300 K$, to $1500 K$ using the expression

$E_{thermal}=k_bT$

To the energy of a photon with a wavelength of $500 nm$ using the expression

$E_{photon}=\frac{h_{planck}c}{\lambda}$

Where:
- $k_b=1.3806503\times10^{-23}$

> [!answer]
> $E_{thermal}=k_bT$
> $\frac{E_{thermal}(1500K)}{E_{thermal}(300K)}=5$
> Which is a 5x increase in energy.
