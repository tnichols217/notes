If copper (which has a melting point of 1085°C) homogeneously nucleates at 849°C, calculate the critical radius given values of $-1.77 \times 10^9$ J/m3 and 0.200 J/m2, respectively, for the latent heat of solidification and the surface free energy.

Suppose that a steel of eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C) is cooled to 500°C from 760°C in less than 0.5 s and held at this temperature.

## a

How long will it take for the austenite (γ)-to-pearlite(α+Fe3C) transformation to begin? Go to 50% completion? To 100% completion?

> [!answer]
> Begin: $0.8~s$
> 50%: $4~s$
> 100%: $10~s$

## b

Using the convention that rate = $\frac{1}{t_{0.5}}$ what is the transformation rate at this temperature?

> [!answer]
> $\frac{1}{4~s}$

# 3

Using the isothermal transformation diagram for a 0.45 wt% C steel alloy (Figure 11.50), determine the final microstructure (in terms of just the microconstituents present) of a small specimen that has been subjected to the following time-temperature treatments. In each case, assume that the specimen begins at 845°C, and that it has been held at this temperature long enough to have achieved a complete and homogeneous austenitic (i.e. γ-iron) structure.

## a

Rapidly cool to 250°C, hold for $10^3$ s, then quench to room temperature.

> [!answer]
> Martensite

## b

Rapidly cool to 400°C, hold for 500 s, then quench to room temperature.

> [!answer]
> Bainite

## c

Rapidly cool to 650°C, hold at this temperature for 3 s, rapidly cool to 400°C, hold for 10 s, then quench to room temperature.

> [!answer]
> Ferrite/$\alpha$, pearlite, bainite, martensite

## d

Rapidly cool to 625°C, hold for 1 s, then quench to room temperature.

> [!answer]
> Proeutectoid ferrite, pearlite, and mertensite

Consider the differences between metastable and equilibrium states.

## a

Martensite is a metastable phase that can be generated in steels and other systems (including other alloys, crystals, and even proteins). Describe 2 characteristics of the martensitic transformation that distinguish it from transformations that result in equilibrium microstructures.

> [!answer]
> - There is no diffusion ­— as it does not change over time
> - Its stucture highly depends on how it was cooled

## b

In terms of heat treatment and the development of microstructure (especially metastable vs. equilibrium states), what are two major limitations of phase diagrams like the iron-iron carbide phase diagram?

> [!answer]
> - Can't predict how long it takes for a transformation to happen
> - Cannot predict when metastable phases happen

# 5

This week, we introduced a fourth strengthening mechanism: precipitation hardening. Compare the mechanism of strengthening involved in precipitation hardening to the mechanism underlying strain hardening (think about diffusion and dislocations).

> [!answer]
> - In both, movement is slowed, which makes the metal stronger
> - Strain hardening introduces dislocations while precipitation hardening introduces $\theta$ particles
