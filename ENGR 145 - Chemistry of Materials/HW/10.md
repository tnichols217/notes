To the right you are given the phase diagram for the Pb-Sn system (binary eutectic). Say we have a 30 wt% Sn – 70 wt% Pb alloy that is gradually cooled from 300°C to 50°C.

![[ENGR 145 - Chemistry of Materials/HW/10/1.png]]

## a

Is this a hypreutectic or hypoeutectic alloy?

> [!answer]
> hypoeutectic, as the composition is left of the eutectic composition.

## b

Describe the microstructure that would develop during cooling (can use pictures, but be sure that everything is legible and clearly labeled). Be sure to specify **both** the *phases* and *microconstituents* present.

> [!answer]
> While the mixture is from 300-250°C, it is all homogenously liquid.
> While cooling from 250°C to the eutectic isotherm, solid alpha particles form in the liquid
> Once it cools below the eutectic isotherm, alternating layers of alpha and beta will form around the alpha particles as well, all microconstituents are solid now.

## c

What is the composition (in wt% Sn) of each of the microconstituents present after cooling?

> [!answer]
> Both the primary and eutectic alpha have a Sn composition of 18.3%, while the eutectic beta has a composition of 97.8% Sn.

## d

How is the resulting microstructure different from what would be developed if the same cooling regime was applied to a 10 wt% Sn - 90 wt% Pb alloy?

> [!answer]
> While cooling, it passes through an alpha only phase, which means that the alpha has solidified, trapping liquid beta within it. The liquid beta then only cools once it reaches the alpha+beta phase. This means that the structure will look mainly alpha with small beta patches within each alpha particle.

Find a research paper that uses phase diagrams to inform the design and/or analysis of a particular material. Provide the name and citation for the paper. In a few sentences, specify the following:

## a

The material system/phase diagram being used (e.g. Cu-Zn, Sn-Pb, etc.)

> [!answer]
> ![[Pasted image 20240411001445.png]]
> Critical Evaluation and Thermodynamic Optimization of the Cu-Zn, Cu-Se and Zn-Se Binary Systems
> https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/12/9/1401

## b

The desired design result (e.g. changing a particular property, troubleshooting a manufacturing process)

> [!answer]
> To refine and create a more accurate phase diagram for various Cu binary eutectic systems in order to predict how other Cu binary eutectic systems will act.

## c

How the authors used phase diagrams to achieve their result

> [!answer]
> By creating the phase diagrams, the achieved their result.

To the right is the iron-iron carbide phase diagram, which we have examined in class. As a reminder, this phase diagram extends from 0 wt% C to 6.70 wt% C, with an intermetallic compound (cementite, Fe3C) existing at 6.70 wt% C. Though we have mostly used the lever rule in simpler phase diagrams, but we can also employ it to determine mass/weight fractions for more complex systems. Consider a 0.25 wt% C – 95.75 wt% Fe alloy.

## a

Using the lever rule, what are the mass fractions of the α and γ phases at 750°C? Show all work.

> [!answer]
> Left Side: 0.05%
> Overall composition: 0.25%
> Right Side: 0.6%
> Tie Length: 0.55%
> 
> $W_\alpha=$

## b

What are the mass fractions at 600°C? Show all work. (Hint: remember that below the eutectic isotherm, the compositions of each phase are determined by the compositions at the eutectic isotherm)

# 4

Name the 2 stages involved in the formation of particles of a new phase. Briefly describe each, including the driving forces behind each stage.

# 5

Consider two different microstructures:

![[PHYS 121 - Physics 1/HW/3/images/5a.svg]] ![[5b.svg]]

In terms of the *driving forces behind nucleation and diffusion*, why do these microstructures develop differently? (Hint: think about homogeneous vs heterogeneous nucleation)
