To the right you are given the phase diagram for the Pb-Sn system (binary eutectic). Say we have a 30 wt% Sn – 70 wt% Pb alloy that is gradually cooled from 300°C to 50°C.

## a

Is this a hypreutectic or hypoeutectic alloy?

## b

Describe the microstructure that would develop during cooling (can use pictures, but be sure that everything is legible and clearly labeled). Be sure to specify **both** the *phases* and *microconstituents* present.

## c

What is the composition (in wt% Sn) of each of the microconstituents present after cooling?

## d

How is the resulting microstructure different from what would be developed if the same cooling regime was applied to a 10 wt% Sn - 90 wt% Pb alloy?

# 2

Find a research paper that uses phase diagrams to inform the design and/or analysis of a particular material. Provide the name and citation for the paper. In a few sentences, specify the following:

## a

The material system/phase diagram being used (e.g. Cu-Zn, Sn-Pb, etc.)

## b

The desired design result (e.g. changing a particular property, troubleshooting a manufacturing process)

## c

How the authors used phase diagrams to achieve their result

To the right is the iron-iron carbide
phase diagram, which we have
examined in class. As a reminder,
this phase diagram extends from 0
wt% C to 6.70 wt% C, with an
intermetallic compound (cementite,
Fe3C) existing at 6.70 wt% C. Though
we have mostly used the lever rule
in simpler phase diagrams, but we
can also employ it to determine
mass/weight fractions for more
complex systems. Consider a 0.25
wt% C – 95.75 wt% Fe alloy.
