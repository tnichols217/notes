To the right you are given the phase diagram for the Pb-Sn system (binary eutectic). Say we have a 30 wt% Sn – 70 wt% Pb alloy that is gradually cooled from 300°C to 50°C.

## a

Is this a hypreutectic or hypoeutectic alloy?

## b

Describe the microstructure that would develop during cooling (can use pictures, but be sure that everything is legible and clearly labeled). Be sure to specify **both** the *phases* and *microconstituents* present.

## c

What is the composition (in wt% Sn) of each of the microconstituents present after cooling?

## d

How is the resulting microstructure different from what would be developed if the same cooling regime was applied to a 10 wt% Sn - 90 wt%
