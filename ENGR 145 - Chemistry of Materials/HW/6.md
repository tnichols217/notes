Shown below on the left is a figure obtained by measuring the macroscopic expansion of length of a rod of pure gold, $\frac{\Delta I}{I_0}$, as a function of temperature and simultaneously using x-ray diffraction to measure $\frac{\Delta a}{a_0}$ , where $a$ is the lattice parameter of the unit cell. From this data set the authors obtained the following expression for the concentration of vacancies as a function of temperature

$\frac{\Delta N}{N}=\frac{N_V}{N}=\exp(1.0)\exp\left( -\frac{0.94~eV}{kT} \right)$

## a

Calculate the fraction of vacant sites in gold at 950Â°C. Plot this value on Fig 3 noting
the vertical axis is logarithmic.

> $=\exp(1.0)\exp\left( -\frac{0.94}{8.6173\times 10^{-5}(950+273.15)} \right)$
> $=3.64\times 10^{-4}$

## b

Assuming the density of gold is $18.4~g/cm^3$ at $950\degree C$, and using the result from Part a, calculate the number of vacancies in $1~cm^3$ of gold at $950\degree C$.

> [!answer]
>$N_V=3.64\times10^{-4}N$
>$N=\frac{18.4(6.023\times10^{23})}{197}$
>$N$

## c

On Fig 2, the authors have superimposed data obtained during heating and also during cooling back down. Explain what they are demonstrating by showing that they get the same result in either direction.
