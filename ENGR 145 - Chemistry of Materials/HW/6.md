Shown below on the left is a figure obtained by measuring the macroscopic expansion of length of a rod of pure gold, $\DeltaI$, as a funcEon of temperature and simultaneously  
using x-ray diffracEon to measure Da/aO , where a is the laHce parameter of the unit cell.  
From this data set the authors obtained the following expression for the concentraEon  
of vacancies as a funcEon of temperature
