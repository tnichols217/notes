Shown below on the left is a figure obtained by measuring the macroscopic expansion of length of a rod of pure gold, $\frac{\Delta I}{I_0}$, as a function of temperature and simultaneously using x-ray diffraction to measure $\frac{\Delta a}{a_0}$ , where $a$ is the lattice parameter of the unit cell. From this data set the authors obtained the following expression for the concentration of vacancies as a function of temperature

$\frac{\Delta N}{N}=\frac{N_V}{N}=\exp(1.0)\exp\left( -\frac{0.94~eV}{kT} \right)$

## b

Assuming the density of gold is $18.4~g/cm^3$ at $950\degree C$, and using the result from Part a, calculate the number of vacancies in $1~cm^3$ of gold at $950\degree C$.

> [!answer]
>$N_V=3.64\times10^{-4}N$
>$N=\frac{18.4(6.023\times10^{23})}{197}$
>$N_V=2.03\times10^{19}$ sites

## c

On Fig 2, the authors have superimposed data obtained during heating and also during cooling back down. Explain what they are demonstrating by showing that they get the same result in either direction.

> [!answer]
> The data points on the graph all fall upon the same line whether it be heating or cooling, sticking very strictly to the linear fit, without lag or variance. This also shows a full recovery across heating and cooling.

# 2

Calculate the number of vacancies per cubic centimeter in iron at $850\degree C$. The energy for vacancy formation is $1.08~eV/atom$. The density and atomic weight for Fe are $7.65~g/cm^3$ and $55.85~g/mol$, respectively.

> [!answer]
> $N=7.65\left( \frac{6.02\times10^{-23}}{55.85} \right)$
> $N_V=N\exp\left( -\frac{1.08}{8.673\times10^{-5}(1123.15)} \right)$
> $N=1.17\times10^{18}~ cm^{-3}$

# 3

In ionic ceramics, Shottky defects are described a stoichiometric set of vacancies.
Define the term stoichiometric.
Describe a stoichiometric set of vacancies for $MgO$ and for $Al_2O_3$.

> [!answer]
> Reactants are in a set ratio in order to produce a certain product. In a Shottky defect, that same ratio is missing from a lattice.
> 
> $MgO$: 1$Mg$ and 1$O$ vacancy
> $Al_2O_3$: 2$Al$ and 3$O$ vacancy

Explain how the strongly directional nature of covalent bonding would affect the energy cost of forming and moving dislocations in a material like silicon.

> [!answer]
> Dislocation formation in an area requires bonds of an atom to be bent or moved away from their original state
