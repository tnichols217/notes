Shown below on the left is a figure obtained by measuring the macroscopic expansion of length of a rod of pure gold, $\frac{\Delta I}{I_0}$, as a function of temperature and simultaneously using x-ray diffraction to measure $\frac{\Delta a}{a_0}$ , where $a$ is the lattice parameter of the unit cell. From this data set the authors obtained the following expression for the concentration of vacancies as a function of temperature

$\frac{\Delta N}{N}=\frac{N_V}{N}=\exp(1.0)\exp()$
