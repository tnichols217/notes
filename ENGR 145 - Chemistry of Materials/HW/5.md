### a

> [!answer]
> Unable to tell, since isotactic PP is isotactic, but it also has a larger side group than the atactic PVC.

### b

> [!answer]
> Linear and syndiotactic is more likely to crystallize than cross-linked. So the polypropylene is more likely to crystallize

### c

> [!answer]
> Linear and isotactic as it is more likely to crystallize than network, which is a 3D stucture. So Polystyrene is more likely to crystallize.

### d

> [!answer]
> Block is more likely to crystallize than graft, as the shape of connected polymers are completely different in size. So the poly(acrylonitrile-isoprene) is easier to crystallize.
