Compute repeat unit molecular weights for the following

## a

 polytetrafluoroethylene

## b

 poly(methyl methacrylate)

## c

nylon 6,6

## d

 poly(ethylene terephthalate)

# 5

The following table lists molecular weight data for a polytetrafluoroethylene material. Compute the following:

## a

the number-average molecular weight

## b

the weight-average molecular weight

## c

the degree of polymerization.

# 11

Sketch portions of a linear polypropylene molecule that are

## a

syndiotactic

## b

atactic

## c

# 12

# 23

## a

> [!answer]
> Unable to tell, since isotactic PP is isotactic, but it also has a larger side group than the atactic PVC.

## b

> [!answer]
> Linear and syndiotactic is more likely to crystallize than cross-linked. So the polypropylene is more likely to crystallize

## c

> [!answer]
> Linear and isotactic as it is more likely to crystallize than network, which is a 3D stucture. So Polystyrene is more likely to crystallize.

## d

> [!answer]
> Block is more likely to crystallize than graft, as the shape of connected polymers are completely different in size. So the poly(acrylonitrile-isoprene) is easier to crystallize.
