The following table lists molecular weight data for a polytetrafluoroethylene material. Compute the following:

![[ENGR 145 - Chemistry of Materials/HW/5/Tables#^5|Tables]]

## a

the number-average molecular weight

> [!answer]
> $\sum\limits_wwx_i(w),w\in\{15000,25000,35000,45000,55000,65000,75000,85000\}$
> $=49800~g/mol$

## b

the weight-average molecular weight

> [!answer]
> $\sum\limits_wwx_i(w),w\in\{15000,25000,35000,45000,55000,65000,75000,85000\}$
> $=55200~g/mol$

## c

the degree of polymerization.

> [!answer]
> $DP$

# 11

Sketch portions of a linear polypropylene molecule that are

## a

syndiotactic

## b

atactic

## c

isotactic

# 12

Sketch cis and trans structures for

## a

polybutadiene

## b

polychloroprene

## c

polyisoprene

# 23

## a

> [!answer]
> Unable to tell, since isotactic PP is isotactic, but it also has a larger side group than the atactic PVC.

## b

> [!answer]
> Linear and syndiotactic is more likely to crystallize than cross-linked. So the polypropylene is more likely to crystallize

## c

> [!answer]
> Linear and isotactic as it is more likely to crystallize than network, which is a 3D stucture. So Polystyrene is more likely to crystallize.

## d

> [!answer]
> Block is more likely to crystallize than graft, as the shape of connected polymers are completely different in size. So the poly(acrylonitrile-isoprene) is easier to crystallize.
