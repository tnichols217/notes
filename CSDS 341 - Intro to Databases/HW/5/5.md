> $A\subseteq AE$ by definition
> $AE\to A$ by reflexivity

> $B\to C$ by transitivity
> $B\to D$ given
> $B\to BC$ by augmentation
> $BC\to CD$ by augmentation
> $B\to CD$ by transitivity

### b

> [!answer]
> $B^{+}=\{B\}$
> $B^{+}=\{B,D\}$ by $B\to D$

### a

> [!answer]
> Given $R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)$, $A\to B, B\to CG, C\to FD, D\to E, E\to G$, and $R_{1}(A, B, C, F), R_{2}(D, E, G)$
> $R_{1}\cap R_{2}=\emptyset$
> And thus $R_{1}\cap R_{2}$ determines nothing, and is thus lossy.

### b

> [!answer]
> Given $R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)$, $A\to BFG, B\to CG, AB\to G, C\to D, D\to E, F\to E$, and $R_{1}(A, B, C, F), R_{2}(C, D, E, G)$

> $F=R_{1}\cap R_{2}=C$
> 
> $F^{+}=C^{+}$
> $\{C\}\subseteq C^{+}$ by definition
> $\{C,D\}\subseteq C^{+}$ by$C\to D$
> $\{C,D,E\}\subseteq C^{+}$ by$D\to E$
> 
> No more can be determined.
> 
> Since $R_{1}\not\subseteq F^{+}$ and $R_{2}\not\subseteq F^{+}$, this is not lossless.

### c

> [!answer]
> Given $R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)$, $A\to B, B\to C, BC\to F, D\to EG$, and $R_{1}(A, D, E, G), R_{2}(A, B, C, F)$

> Since $R_{2}\subseteq F^{+}$, this decomposition is lossless.

### a

> [!answer]
> Given $R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)$ and $A\to BHI, C\to E, E\to F, BC\to D, F\to G, H\to G, CD\to A$
> 
> The following transitivity chains exist:
> 1. $C\to E\to F\to G$
> 2. $CD\to A\to BHI\to 1$
> 3. $BC\to D\to 2$
> 4. $H\to G$
> 
> $ABCDEFGHI^{+}=ABCDHI^{+}$ by 1
> $ABCDHI^{+}=CD^{+}$ by 2
> $CD^{+}$ is minimal.
> 
> $ABCDEFGHI^{+}=ABCDHI^{+}$ by 1
> $ABCDHI^{+}=BC^{+}$ by 3 and 2
> $BC^{+}$ is minimal.
> 
> Thus, our candidate keys are $BC$ and $CD$

### b

> [!answer]
> $\{B, C, D\}$ exist as parts of CKs, and thus are prime attributes

### a

> [!answer]
> Given $A\to BGHI, C\to EF, E\to F, BC\to ADE, F\to G, H\to G, CD\to A$
> 
> $C\to E\implies C\to EF$ as $E\to F$ is also given
> $BC\to AD\implies BC\to ADE$ as $C\to E$
> $BC\to D\implies BC\to AD$ as $CD\to A$
> $A\to BHI\implies A\to BGHI$ as $H\to G$
> 
> Which leaves us with:
> $BC\to D$
> $CD\to A$
> $A\to BHI$
> $C\to E$
> $E\to F$
> $F\to G$
> $H\to G$

### b

> [!answer]
> None of the one to one dependencies are repeated, so these all cannot be reduced further.
> 
> $A\to BHI$ is irreducible as there are no other relations between $B, H, I$
> $BC\to D$ is irreducible as $B, C$ are unrelated
> $CD\to A$ is the same
> 
> The validity of the dependencies are proven in part a.

### a

> [!answer]
> Given $R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K)$ and $A\to BCD, HI\to J, AEFG\to HIK$
> 
> The only irreducible determinants are $A, HI, AEFG$
> 
> The only one of those three that determine all of $R$ is $AEFG$
> 
> $AEFG\to HIK$
> $HI\to J$ as $HIK\to HI$
> $AEFG\to BCD$ as $AEFG\to A$
> 
> Therefore it is $AEFG$

### b

> [!answer]
> $J$ only depends on $HI$, not our key of $AEFG$

### c

> [!answer]
> $R_{1}(A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K),R_{2}(A, B, C, D)$
> 
> There is no longer any partial dependency, as $BCD$  only depended on $A$, not $AEFG$, the key of our $R_{1}$
> 
> It does not achieve NF3 as $J$ transitively depends on the primary key through $HI$.

### d

> [!answer]
> $R_{1}(A, E, F, G, H, I, K),R_{2}(A, B, C, D),R_{3}(H, I, J)$
> 
> There is no longer any transitive dependency, as $J$ was moved into another table.
> 
> This is also in BNCF as all columns directly depend on the super key, additionally no non-prime attributes can determine any prime attributes.

### e

> [!answer]
> For our first decomposition
> $R_{1}\cap R_{2}=A$
> In $R_{2}$, $A\to BCD$
> $A^{+}=\{A, B, C, D\}=R_{2}$
> And thus this decomposition is lossless.
> 
> For the second decomposition
> $R_{1}\cap R_{3}=HI$
> In $R_{3}$, $HI\to J$
> $HI^{+}=\{H, I, J\}=R_{3}$
> And thus this decomposition is also lossless.

### f

> [!answer]
> Yes
> $A\to BCD$ is within $R_{2}$
> $HI\to J$ is within $R_{3}$
> $AEFG\to HIK$ is within $R_{1}$
> 
> All dependencies are conserved.

### h

 > [!answer]
 > Given $J\to I$ and $R_{1}(A, E, F, G, H, I, K),R_{2}(A, B, C, D),R_{3}(H, I, J)$
 > 
 > $R_{1}(A, E, F, G, H, J, K),R_{2}(A, B, C, D),R_{4}(J,I)$
 > Since $HI$ determines $J$, $R_{1}$ is able to be changed to this.
 > Since $J$ on its own is able to determine $I$, we no longer need $HI\to J$ in $R_{3}$
