The `USING` statement tends to be less explicit and clear when doing merges, additionally it is not possible to `JOIN` when the column names are different across tables.

### a

#### i

The attribute ordering will be:
`ID, name, venue, begDate, endDate, type, cost, status`

#### ii

The attribute ordering will be (when joined with `artist`):
`ID, name, venue, begDate, endDate, type, cost, status, fname, lname, status, dob`

The attribute ordering of the SQL query provided below $ii$ will be (when joined with `transact`):
`ID, name, venue, begDate, endDate, type, cost, status, eID, patron, wID, tranDate`

### b

This joins all tables on their ID column (among other things), but this is mainly the issue as it is highly unlikely that you are looking for exhibitions, works, and artists that have the same id where the work has the same name as the exhibition, as this is a meaningless query. Instead, you probably would want to match exhibitions up with works through the `exhWork` table, without natural joins, then to artists with the `artWork` table.
