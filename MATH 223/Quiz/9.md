# A

$\vec F(x,y)=\langle-y\sin x+2x,\cos x\rangle$

$\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}=-\sin x$
$\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}=-\sin x$

Since $\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}$, this means that the vector field is conservative

# B

$\int-y\sin x+2x~dx$
$=y\cos x+x^2+C$

$\int\cos x~dy$
$=y\cos x+C$

$f(x,y)=y\cos x+x^2+C$

# C

Since $\vec F$ is conservative, a line integral on $R^2$ of $\vec F$ is equivalent to the
