$f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-xy+x$

$\nabla f=\langle 2x-y+1,2y-x\rangle$

$\nabla f=\langle0,0\rangle\iff(x,y)=(-2/3,-1/3)$

$H(f)=\begin{bmatrix}2&-1\\-1&2\end{bmatrix}$
$|H(f)|=5$

Since the determinant at $(-2/3,-1/3)$ is positive we can conclude it is a max/min. Since $H(f)_{xx}$ is positive, we can conclude that it is a mi
