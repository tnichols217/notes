$\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow(\frac{\pi}{4},0)}\tan x\cos y$

$\tan x$ is continuous at $\frac{\pi}{4}$
$\cos y$ is continuous at $0$

$=\tan\frac{\pi}{4}\cos0$
$=1$

# 19

$\lim\limits_{(x,y)\rightarrow(0,0)}\frac{x^2-y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$

$\frac{-y^2}{y}$ has a point discontinuity at $0$, but has the limit of $0$
$\frac{x^2}{x}$ has a point discontinuity at $0$, but also has the limit of $0$

$=0$
$\square$

# 23

$\lim\limits_{(x,y,z)\rightarrow(0,0,0)}\frac{x+y+z}{x^2+y^2+z^2}$

$\frac{z}{z^2}$ is not continuous at $0$, and the limit does not exist, with the positive limit approaching $\infty$ and the negative limit approaching $-\infty$
$\frac{y}{y^2}$ is not continuous at $0$, and the limit also does not exist and has the same one-sided limits as $z$
$\frac{x}{x^2}$ has the same properties as $y$ and $z$
