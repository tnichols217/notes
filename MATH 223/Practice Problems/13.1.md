$\vec r(t)=\langle t,t^3,t^2+1\rangle$
If $\vec r$ intersects then $xy$ plane, its $z$ value must be $0$ somewhere.

$t^2+1=0$
$t=i$

$\vec r$ does not intersect the $xy$ plane unless $t$ is a complex variable and can have the value of $i$

$\vec r(t)=\langle1-\cos(2t),t+\sin t,t^2\rangle$

$\vec r$ will intersect the $yz$ plane if its $x$ value equals $0$ at some point.

$1-\cos(2t)=0$
$1=\cos(2t)$
$t=R\pi,\quad \text{where }R\in\mathbb I$

This proves that $\vec r$ intersects the $yz$ plane in infinitely many places
$\square$

In order for $\vec r$ to never cross the $yz$ plane, it must have all values on one side of it, or disconnected values on both sides of it.

However, we can see that:

$-1\le\cos(x)\le1$
$0\le1-\cos(2t)\le2$

Where the domain of the x value of $\vec r$ is $[0,2]$, and therefore never crosses the $yz$ plane.
$\square$

$\vec r(t)=(9\cos t)\hat i+(9\sin t)\hat j$

Since $\vec r$ has no $\hat k$ component, its $z$ value is always $0$, and it must lie on the $xy$ plane.
$\square$

We can convert $\hat i\hat j\hat k$ notation back into $xyz$ notation

$\vec r(t)=\cases{x=9\cos t\\y=9\sin t}$
$\vec r(t)=\cases{x^2=9^2\cos^2 t\\y^2=9^2\sin^2 t}$
$\vec r(t)=\cases{x^2=9^2\cos^2 t\\y^2=9^2\sin^2 t\\}$
