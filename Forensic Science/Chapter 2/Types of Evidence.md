# Evidence
## Locard's Exchange Principle
- Contact causes cross-transfer of physical evidence
- The cross transfer indicated intensity, duration, and nature of the contact
- Forensics is built upon the evidence that cross-contact creates

## Trace Evidence
- Small pieces of evidence that can be found at a crime scene
- Types include
	- hair
	- fiber
	- paint chips
	- body fluids
	- stains
	- powders
	- explosive residue
	- glass particles

## Direct Evidence
- Firsthand observations
	- Eyewitnesses
	- Police dashcam and bodycam
	- Video surveillance
	- Voice recordings
	- Written and Signed Ransom Notes
	- Reports

## Circumstantial evidence
- Imply a fact, but doesn't prove it
	- Physical
		- Prints
		- Bite marks
		- Tire prints
		- Ballistic evidence
		- Synthetic fibers
	- Biological
		- DNA
		- Natural Fibers
		- Hair

## Class / Individual
- Class evidence narrows down to a group of people that could have left that evidence
- Individual evidence can only be one specific person, like DNA or Fingerprints
