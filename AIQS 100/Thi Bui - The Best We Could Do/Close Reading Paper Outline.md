# Prompt

**Personal History**: Graphic memoirs are uniquely positioned to re-imagine history through intimate and creative engagements with personal, family, and collective history, memory archives, and cultural artifacts. Thi Bui’s The Best We Could Do re-imagines dominant and official histories of the Vietnam War from different social, gendered, and cultural perspectives, providing personal perspectives that shed new light on the major historical events of the war and her family’s journey. She does so by engaging in a number of research and creative practices: interviewing family members, revisiting family albums and archives, using historical photographs, interpreting personal experiences, challenging dominant narratives, and connecting the personal with larger societal dynamics and collective experiences.

**Questions**: What sort of **misrepresentations**, **stereotypes**, or **erasures** does Thi Bui confront in her work? In order to reimagine dominant U.S. depictions of the Vietnam War, what strategies does she use to rewrite the past when blending personal and collective experiences? Choose a specific scene in the book and reflect on the way in which Thi Bui addresses misrepresentations and offers a Vietnamese viewpoint on the events of the Vietnam War.
