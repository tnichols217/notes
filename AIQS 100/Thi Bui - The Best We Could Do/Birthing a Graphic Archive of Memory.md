# Reflection Questions

1. What is the main thesis of Stella Oh's essay? Please rephrase the thesis in your own words. Do you agree or disagree with her main argument?
	- She claims that the United States has been twisting the facts about the Vietnam War to portray a story that glorifies the US and puts down Vietnam. She also claims that Thi Bui's graphic novel is a fresh take on the subject, showing the "other side" of the story — from a woman's point of view.
2. How does Thi Bui bridge the political and the personal in her memoir according to Stella Oh? Can you identify a few concrete examples Oh uses to make this claim?

3. What does Stella Oh mean when she argues that Thi Bui writes a feminist version of the Vietnam War? What examples does she provide for this argument?
