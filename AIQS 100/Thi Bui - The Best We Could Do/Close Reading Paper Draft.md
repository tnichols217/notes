> Throughout the text *The Best We Could Do* by Thi Bui, Bui explores the multiple impacts of the Vietnam war through the unique storytelling method of the graphic novel. She explores her parents as well as her own story as a way for her to connect back to her parents and repay them all they went through to raise her. One such impact she explores is the representation and recollection of truth — both in the sense of a objective history, but also on a much more personal level. Initially, Bui tells the story of struggling to understand the conflicting evidence, but we progress into a state where can can relate and even empathize through themes including trauma and childbirth. The scene on pages 206-210 especially illustrate this idea. In *The Best We Could Do*, Thi Bui refines her beliefs on the events of the Vietnam war and their personal impact on her. She compares the evidence commonly seen in American history against first hand stories handed down from her parents and uses such information along with her own experiences to put the impact of history into the perspective of her own life.

> The story told in American history books on the Vietnam war is one that majority of people educated on the Vietnam war would know. Bui finds herself confused and finding inconsistencies in this official story with the one her parents told her as a kid. On page 207, Bui recalls common misconceptions and misrepresentations of her people in American propaganda: "Bad Guys: the Viet Cong (communist front in the South). The South Vietnamese: bar girls and hookers; corrupt leaders; kids looking for handouts; small, effete men; and papa-san" (207). The propaganda she mentions is displayed in the style of a poster, converse to the style of the rest of her novel: containing larger titles and subtext without speech bubbles along with images arranged in a collage style all within a singular comic frame. This difference brings interest to the topic she discusses — and flies directly in the face of the entire story she has been telling
