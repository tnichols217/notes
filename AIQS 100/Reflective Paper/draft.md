> Throughout my time in this AIQ Seminar (The Art of the Graphic Memoir), I have noticed that I have substantially improved my own understanding and analysis of texts, particularly in the area of Graphic Memoirs as that was the focus of this course. Specifically, I have learned multiple ways that authors utilize color, framing, text, detail, and especially synthesis between mediums to create a deep work.

> In my first close reading essay of this class, and my first close reading essay of all time, although I wish I could have done better, I believe that the process that took me to what I submitted was a substantial journey. I learned how to use a common line of reasoning as well as signposting in order to create a more clearly laid out essay. In the first sentence of my third last paragraph I say "Bui herself still has not come to a complete understanding of the situation at hand", clearly stating at which point in my reasoning I am at and offering a piece of context for the rest of the paragraph as well as a place to integrate back into the main theme of the essay. Before I made this revision I have gotten feedback that it was hard to follow what point I was trying to make throughout the essay.

> In the same essay, I also observed that the evolution of my thesis was significantly greater than I expected it to be. Going in to writing the essay I thought I had a solid idea I was trying to covey in my essay, but the more I wrote the essay, the more I realized I needed to clarify and both condense and elaborate in my thesis. In the end I settled on a thesis distributed across the introductory paragraph, which I believe was descriptive and informative enough to jump you into my essay.

> In the second essay of this class I focused more on comparisons and parallels. In this essay I still utilized more signposting than I am used to — once again to signify changes in my essay and to offer some background information when abruptly switching topics. In this essay, I opted to attempt to tell both author's stories at the same time to draw on strong similarities between the two as well as their stark differences. Although I don't believe I managed to achieve this very well, it was a novel experience for me and I believe that even in its weakness it does manage to offer some unique insight on the comparison of the two authors and their works. This essay has taught me to more clearly outline my thoughts and ideas before putting them into words and paragraphs. Although it does logically make sense — according to my reviewers — I would have preferred if I came to its final organization earlier in the revision cycle to ease my own development of the essay. I have learned to not only outline main ideas and points — like I have before this essay — but to also specifically plan the structure of the final product.
