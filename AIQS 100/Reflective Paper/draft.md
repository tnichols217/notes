> Throughout my time in this AIQ Seminar (The Art of the Graphic Memoir), I have noticed that I have substantially improved my own understanding and analysis of texts, particularly in the area of Graphic Memoirs as that was the focus of this course. Specifically, I have learned multiple ways that authors utilize color, framing, text, detail, and especially synthesis between mediums to create a deep work.

> In my first close reading essay of this class, and my first close reading essay of all time, although I wish I could have done better, I believe that the process that took me to what I submitted was a substantial journey. I learned how to use a common line of reasoning as well as signposting in order to create a more clearly laid out essay. In the first sentence of my third last paragraph I say "Bui herself still has not come to a complete understanding of the situation at hand", clearly stating at which point in my reasoning I am at and offering a piece of context for the rest of the paragraph as well as a place to integrate back into the main theme of the essay. Before I made this revision I have gotten feedback that it was hard to follow what point I was trying to make throughout the essay.
