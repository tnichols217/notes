# Look Back

Gather all of your final writing projects from the course, taking the time and opportunity to look over your work and consider its strengths and weaknesses, one piece’s relationship to another, and how you might see development or growth in one or more writing strategies that we have explored over the semester.

# Take Stock in the Present

As you look back through your final essays, observe changes in your writing over the course of the semester: what are you proud of, what weaknesses have you worked to overcome, what strengths have you developed, and what writing habits and processes have you developed that are most helpful to you? Select examples and evidence from your essays to demonstrate your learning processes and what kind of writer you are now.

# Project into the Future

Then, look forward to explain how the knowledge and skill that you have learned in your AIQ Seminar will be helpful to you in the future—on a particular writing assignment you might have, in a future class, in your major coursework, and/or in your future career. You might explain how this course has helped you develop a writing process, particular strategies and skills for writing that will be helpful to you, and/or knowledge about yourself as a writer. How might you apply what you have learned in AIQS to new writing situations in the future? What kind of writer do you envision yourself being in the future?

# Consider some or all of the AIQS Learning Outcomes

listed on the course syllabus, and describe your development toward those outcomes. In addition to reflecting on your work over the semester, look forward to the future by explaining how you see yourself developing further as a writer and by describing goals and desires that you hope to achieve through writing, in college and beyond.
