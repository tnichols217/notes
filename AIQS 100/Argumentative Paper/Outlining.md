# Thesis

## Identity

Identity is a complex, multifaceted, and ambiguous concept. We sometimes think of our identities in relation to specific labels, but they are rarely, fixed, static or monolithic. Our identities are **changing and evolving** throughout our lifetime and they are often the product of our **relationships and interactions**, **family** and personal histories, **cultural heritage**, education, experience, and the way we interpret our memories and our past. The graphic memoir authors we’ve read in this class engage with the fluid and complex processes of identity formation and identity interrogation in their work. Through their creative narratives, they explore their hybrid identities which have absorbed multiple cultural influences (Satrapi), negotiate assimilation, trauma, and forgetting in their identity formation (Bui), or come to terms with collective guilt and confront family history as a way to construct a different sense of identity (Krug).

What conflicts, challenges, and tensions inform our memoirists’ sense of identity? Can you identify any similar challenges across two of the texts we’ve read? If so, this should be the main theme you focus on, which will inform your thesis. Finally, what creative strategies or memory devices do the authors use to reconstruct their sense of identity throughout their memoirs?

- Inheritance and societal pressures especially during developmental stages have a large impact on a sense of identity and nationalism in these memoirists' lives
- Identity within these memoirists is highly mendelian — inherited from their parents and society, especially in wartime ideology — but also highly volatile and heavily polarized by society on beliefs that run contrary to normal.
- Both Satrapi and Bui initially have a strong difficulty trying to understand themselves, go on a journey of discovery which leads them to further confusion before reaching a resolution with themselves.

- Satrapi was heavily polarized by her multiple understandings in western and eastern ideologies
- Bui was conflicted at her own family's understanding of history versus the common western conception and history
