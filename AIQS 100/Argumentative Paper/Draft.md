> # The Problem of Identity in *Persepolis* and *The Best We Could Do*
> 
> In both Marjane Satrapi's *Persepolis* and Thi Bui's *The Best We Could Do*, their change in identity throughout their stories is a key theme that is strongly influenced by multiple factors within their lives. In *Persepolis*, Satrapi has a long internal battle on who she is mainly due her parent's politically outstanding ideas and a multicultural upbringing in both Iran and Austria, leading her to question who she in and seek things to define herself by. Thi Bui on the other hand, struggles to grapple with her past as her own understanding, her parents' understandings, and the history commonly taught in American schools all clash with each other on some level — all of which are highly traumatic to her and her family. These deep rooted identity issues cause both authors to go on a journey attempting to better understand themselves and come to a resolution on who they are.

> One of the main points of confusion in Marji's identity in Satrapi's *Persepolis* stems from the difference in ideologies between the "East" — most often characterized as more of a group identity — and the "West" — more often characterized as an individualistic ideology. Marji, from *Persepolis*, begins early in her life already with an "Eastern" mentality — trying to fit in with society in religion and governmental policy. Marji self-narrates this in the first chapter: "I was both with religion. At the age of six I was already sure I was the last prophet. This was a few years before the revolution. Before me there had been a few others." Her narration clearly reveals that she was both born in an Eastern world and took up Eastern ideas like religion. But this immediately prefaces her description of her ideal religious policies: "I wanted to be a prophet... Because out maid did not eat with us. Because my father had a Cadillac. And, above all, because my grandmother's knees always ached." Although she grew up in a highly religious society, her reasons for being religious appear to be significantly more individualistic and consumerist as seen in her rationale: wanting a nicer car, wanting to heal people close to her, and wanting a more balanced social structure — all of which could be attributed to similar "Western" ideologies.
