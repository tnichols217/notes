> # The Problem of Identity in *Persepolis* and *The Best We Could Do*
> 
> In both Marjane Satrapi's *Persepolis* and Thi Bui's *The Best We Could Do*, their change in identity throughout their stories is a key theme that is strongly influenced by multiple factors within their lives. In *Persepolis*, Satrapi has a long internal battle on who she is mainly due her parent's politically outstanding ideas and a multicultural upbringing in both Iran and Austria, leading her to question who she in and seek things to define herself by. Thi Bui on the other hand, struggles to grapple with her past as her own understanding, her parents' understandings, and the history commonly taught in American schools all clash with each other on some level — all of which are highly traumatic to her and her family. These deep rooted identity issues cause both authors to go on a journey attempting to better understand themselves and come to a resolution on who they are.

> One of the main points of confusion in Marji's identity in Satrapi's *Persepolis* stems from the difference in ideologies between the "East" — most often characterized as more of a group identity — and the "West" — more often characterized as an individualistic ideology. Marji, from *Persepolis*, begins early in her life already with an "Eastern" mentality — trying to fit in with society in religion and governmental policy. Marji self-narrates this in the first chapter: "I was both with religion. At the age of six I was already sure I was the last prophet. This was a few years before the revolution. Before me there had been a few others." Her narration clearly reveals that she was both born in an Eastern world and took up Eastern ideas like religion. But this immediately prefaces her description of her ideal religious policies: "I wanted to be a prophet... Because out maid did not eat with us. Because my father had a Cadillac. And, above all, because my grandmother's knees always ached." Although she grew up in a highly religious society, her reasons for being religious appear to be significantly more individualistic and consumerist as seen in her rationale: wanting a nicer car, wanting to heal people close to her, and wanting a more balanced social structure — all of which could be attributed to similar "Western" ideologies. Later in the memoir, before she leaves for Austria, there are multiple instances of her standing out in Iranian culture at the time. When her parents came back from Istanbul in chapter 18, they snuck in Western nonconformist materials like pop-idol posters, a denim jacket, and Nike sneakers, of which Marji happily wore out. Marji promptly gets caught and questioned by the morality police for her deviant actions from which out of self interest, she lies in order to escape punishment. Not soon after in chapter 20, Satrapi again defies the local standards by continuing to wear jewelry and speak out against the information taught in school, prompting her quick escape to a more Western country. Her comparatively Western worldview makes it hard for Satrapi to find an identity in Iran's deeply Eastern ideology.

> Once Satrapi arrives in Austria, one would think her highly Western mind would fit right in, but her troubles finding her own identity fail to end. One of her first interactions with a person over there leads her to immediately think "What a traitor! While people were dying in our country, she was talking to me about trivial things. ...I lived with them for ten days," hinting at her immediate inability to fit in in this highly western world. Later in chapter 24, at a party, Satrapi also cites the inability to fit in as she "was turned off by all these public displays of affection. What do you expcet, I came from a traditionalist country," showing that even in a western country, she is too eastern to fit in. She soon after attempts to change her appearance in hopes that her identity would follow. Satrapi says, "The harder I tried to assimilate, the more I had the feeling that I was distancing myself from my culture, betraying my parents and my origins, that I was playing a game by somebody else's rules. ... I even managed to deny my nationality." Because she had failed to fit in, her journey to a western world had ultimately been a failure, leading her to promptly leave and go back home to Iran. Satrapi at this point knows she isn't truly western, but never truly was Iranian by culture in Iran either.

> Thi Bui similarly struggles to understand who she is based on her own multicultural identity. Although she was born in Vietnam, she had majority of her upbringing in America leading her to wonder what she is and where shes from. Thi Bui decides to investigate her own familial history in order to gain a deeper understanding. Beginning in the second chapter, the differences could already been seen. Thi Bui compares her own experience with her sister's: "Once upon a time, I was young and moving to New York to be an artist and live with my artist boyfriend and my mother didn't disown me. Are you going to live together? Um yes? I see. For an immigrant kid, that's living the dream. Whew! A few years earliers, when my oldest sister, LAN, left for medical school and moved in with her boyfriend (and later husband) Mas went through a period of denial" (Bui, 24-25) and one
