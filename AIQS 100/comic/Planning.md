# Synopsis

I get on a van to go to a small village called Langkap, we arrive and the place is really run down and underdeveloped. I take a look into my assigned room and wonder how I'm going to be able to survive here.

The next day we arrive at the school/church and begin to clean. Kids begin to arrive and play with each other, but are still uncertain about us. The kids are barely clothed, and many do not even have shoes. Once enough arrive, we begin to introduce ourselves, then teach them English.

During the break time, all the kids eat then go outside to play around. They seem to be able to enjoy themselves and be happy regardless of their situation. I wonder to myself what it takes for me to be happy.

Once the trip is over, I stare at my room and wonder why I insist on having such expensive/nice things in order for me to feel happy when those kids can do so much with so little.

# Process

Went through multiple revisions of what style I liked for the comic to be in (image 1)

Worked a lot on creating textures, generators for trees, or reusable items within my scenes (image 2)

# Research

I did a significant amount of research looking around the village where we stayed, looking for anything that would be familiar to me. Even though I did not manage to find the places we were on google street view, I still got a general look and feel of the place based off of the images. I also dug into my photo storage and found some images of me there, as seen in the bottom image below.
