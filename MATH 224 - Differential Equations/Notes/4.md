# Forcing and Resonance

## Forced Harmonic Resonators

It takes the form of:

$m\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^2}+b\frac{dy}{dt}+ky=f(t)$

or more commonly as:

$\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^2}+p\frac{dy}{dt}+qy=g(t)$

This is **second-order**, **linear**, **nonhomogeneous** (does have constants on the right side), **constant-coeffecient**, **nonautonomous**

$\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^2}+p\frac{dy}{dt}+qy=0$

Is referred to as the associated **homogenous** equation, as it has nothing on the right side.

## Extended Linearity Principle

Let $y_{p}(t),y_{q}(t)$ be particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous system and $k_1y_{1}(t)+k_2y_2(t)$ be the general solution of the homogeneous system.

1. $k_1y_{1}(t)+k_2y_2(t)+y_p(t)$
   Is the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation
2. $y_{p}(t)-y_{q}(t)$
   Is a solution to the homogeneous equation

### Proof:

$\frac{d^2y}{dt}(y_{h}+y_{p})+p\frac{dy}{dt}(y_{h}+y_{p})+q(y_{h}+y_{p})$
$=0+g(t)=g(t)$

$\frac{d^2y}{dt}(y_{p}-y_{q})+p\frac{dy}{dt}(y_{p}-y_{q})+q(y_{p}-y_{q})$
$=g(t)-g(t)=0$

## Solving for particular solutions of nonhomogeneous equations

Typically, the easiest way to solve for a particular solution is to guess and check based on what $g(t)$ is.

### Exponentials

For example, if $g(t)=ae^{bt}$ we can guess $y(t)=ke^{bt}$ as a solution, and solve for $k$

If $b$ happens to be an eigenvalue, we can guess $y(t)=kte^{bt}$ as the remaining $e^{bt}$ terms will be absorbed by the homogeneous equation

### Sinusoidals

For $g(t)$ being any sinusoidal we can structure our guess as $k_{1}\sin (at)+k_{2}\cos(at)$

For sinusoidals, we may also replace the sinusoidals with an $e^{iat}$ then take the imaginary portion of the solution for $\sin$ or the real portion for $\cos$

For solutions of the form $ae^{it}$, we may solve for a simple solution by solving this equation

$ae^{it}= |a|e^{i(\theta+t)}$

for $\theta$, which happens to be the phase angle, which can be found from the initial complex $a$ with $\arctan$
