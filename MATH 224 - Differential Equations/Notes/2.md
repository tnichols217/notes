# First-Order Systems

First-order systems have multiple related rates that tend to depend on each other for their change over time, for example a predator prey system.

## Vectors and First-Order Systems

Take, for example, this predator-prey system:


$\begin{cases}\frac{dR}{dt}=2R-1.2RF\\\frac{dF}{dt}=-F+0.9RF\end{cases}$

This system can be plotted on an $(R,F)$ plane as a vector or direction field to understand its movement.

Let $\vec P(t)=\langle R(t),F(t)\rangle$
$\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\left\langle  \frac{dR}{dt}, \frac{dF}{dt} \right\rangle$
Let $\vec V(\vec P)$ be $\frac{d\vec P}{dt}$, our original system (in systems that do not depend on time)

This gives us $\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\vec V(\vec P)$

We can now understand that a vector field across all $\vec P$ will have a vector associated by $\vec V(\vec P)$

## Equilibrium Points

Equilibrium points in systems are when $\vec V(\vec P)=\vec 0$, where $\vec P$ is the
