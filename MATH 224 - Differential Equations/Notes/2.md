# First-Order Systems

First-order systems have multiple related rates that tend to depend on each other for their change over time, for example a predator prey system.

## Vectors and First-Order Systems

Take, for example, this predator-prey system:


$\begin{cases}\frac{dR}{dt}=2R-1.2RF\\\frac{dF}{dt}=-F+0.9RF\end{cases}$

This system can be plotted on an $(R,F)$ plane as a vector or direction field to understand its movement.

Let $\vec P(t)=\langle R,F\rangle$
$\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\left\langle  \frac{dR}{dt}, \frac{dF}{dt} \right\rangle$
