# First-Order Systems

First-order systems have multiple related rates that tend to depend on each other for their change over time, for example a predator prey system.

## Vectors and First-Order Systems

Take, for example, this predator-prey system:


$\begin{cases}\frac{dR}{dt}=2R-1.2RF\\\frac{dF}{dt}=-F+0.9RF\end{cases}$

This system can be plotted on an $(R,F)$ plane as a vector or direction field to understand its movement.

Let $\vec P(t)=\langle R(t),F(t)\rangle$
$\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\left\langle  \frac{dR}{dt}, \frac{dF}{dt} \right\rangle$
Let $\vec V(\vec P)$ be $\frac{d\vec P}{dt}$, our original system (in systems that do not depend on time)

This gives us $\frac{d\vec P}{dt}=\vec V(\vec P)$

We can now understand that a vector field across all $\vec P$ will have a vector associated by $\vec V(\vec P)$

## Equilibrium Points

Equilibrium points in systems are when $\vec V(\vec P)=\vec 0$, where $\vec P$ is the equilibrium point
This simply means that if the system were at this point, $\vec P$ would not move over time.

In predator-prey and many other relationships, $\vec P=\vec 0$ will often be an equilibrium point.

## Decoupled Systems

Fully decoupled systems are systems where the variables do not depend on each other, such as:

$\begin{cases} \frac{dx}{dt}=-2x\\ \frac{dy}{dt}=-y\end{cases}$

These can be solved independently in order to find a general solution of the system
