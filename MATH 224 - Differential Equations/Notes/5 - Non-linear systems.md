# Non-linear systems

## Linearization

First, transform the system such that the equilibrium point is at the origin, then calculate the Jacobian matrix, then multiply that matrix by the $\vec{uv}$ vector.

## Nullclines

Nullclines are curves in function space where one of the derivatives are zero, and thus all movement is in the other axis.

Nullclines are often labeled with arrows to dictate the direction of movement across them.
