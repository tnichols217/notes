## Deadline May 5th
You’ll submit a portfolio of artwork for evaluation at the end of the school year. You’ll upload digital images of your work and commentary online.

The three Art and Design portfolios (2-D, 3-D, and Drawing) share a basic, two-section structure, which requires you to show a fundamental competence and range of understanding in visual concerns and methods. Each section contributes to the final portfolio score, which is on a 5-point scale.

Note: You may submit more than one Art and Design portfolio exam in a given year, but each must be a different type of portfolio. You may not duplicate works or images among the portfolios and portfolios may not be combined. For example, if you want to submit a portfolio for both Drawing and 3-D Art and Design, you will need to submit two separate portfolios with two completely different sets of artwork, and you must order two exams.

For the AP 3-D Art and Design portfolio:

-   Your work should focus on the use of three-dimensional (3-D) skills of art and design, including **point, line, shape, plane, layer, form, volume, mass, occupied/unoccupied space, texture, color, value, opacity, transparency, time, unity, variety, rhythm, movement, proportion, scale, balance, emphasis, contrast, repetition, connection, juxtaposition, and hierarchy**.
    
-   Think about how materials, processes, and ideas can be used to make work that involves **space and form**, whether physical or virtual.
-   There’s no preferred or unacceptable content or style.
-   Here are some formats you can submit: figurative or nonfigurative sculpture, architectural models, metal work, ceramics, glasswork, installation, performance, assemblage, and 3-D fabric/fiber arts.
-   Don’t submit video clips—they’re not allowed. You may submit still images from videos or film and composite images.

### Section 1: Sustained Investigation

**15 digital images** ***60% of Score***

You’ll create a body of work that demonstrates:

-   sustained investigation through practice, experimentation, and revision
-   sustained investigation of materials, processes, and ideas
-   synthesis of materials, processes, and ideas
-   3-D design skills

You’ll have to document in writing:

-   the questions that guided your sustained investigation **(600 characters)**
-   how your sustained investigation shows evidence of **practice, experimentation, and revision** guided by your questions **(600 characters)**

**Note:** Your responses to the prompts are evaluated along with the images you submit:

-   The most successful responses in relation to the assessment criteria used here are clearly related to the images of work submitted, directly and completely address the prompts, and provide further evidence of inquiry-based sustained investigation through practice, experimentation, and revision.
-   You must identify all pre-existing work(s) in the Written Evidence portion of your portfolio. Review the [Artistic Integrity Agreement](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/art-design-program/ap-art-design-portfolio-policies) for more information. 
-   Although responses are not evaluated for spelling, grammar, or punctuation, you should make sure your responses are written clearly (e.g., don’t use extreme text speak or eliminate spaces between words).

Description:

- Height, Width, Depth
- Materials: Name, Materials and why **(100 characters)**
- Processes: Process, how, and why **(100 characters)**

### Section 2: Selected Works

Images of **5 works**, **2 views** each, for a total of **10 images** ***40% of Score***

You’ll choose works that demonstrate:

-   3-D design skills
-   synthesis of materials, processes, and ideas

For each work, you’ll have to describe in writing:

-   your ideas
-   the materials you used **(100 characters)**
-   the processes you used **(100 characters)**

Works may come from the Sustained Investigation section, but they do not have to. They may be a group of related works, unrelated works, or a combination of related and unrelated works.

## Requirements and Recommendations for Digital Images

All images must be submitted in JPEG format (file name extension .jpg) and RGB color mode. We recommend that you keep copies of your original images.

There’s a 100-character limit for images, including spaces. When naming images, do not use special characters or symbols, such as < > ' " ( ) + % &.

### Recommended Image Sizes

The image sizes below are recommendations. Your image sizes may be different.

-   Non-square: 530 × 780 pixels
-   Square: 642 × 642 pixels
