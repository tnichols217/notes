# Sustained Investigation

## Questions that guided your sustained investigation (600 characters)

"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over time.

How has my perception of instruments changed? What have instruments meant to me in the past versus now? As a child, instruments overwhelmed me: their complexity, immensity, and sensitivity daunted me. Now, the same instruments hold a sentimental and enjoyable role in my life, a reward—instead of a punishment. I investigate the development of my emotions on the instruments I play; my views on life, entertainment, and hard work; and the duality of dissonance and harmony. How can I simultaneously capture the complex relationship between my progress as an instrumentalist and evolving perspective?

## How your sustained investigation shows evidence of practice, experimentation, and revision guided by your questions (600 characters)

### FIXED: remove title

Initially I wanted to create pieces that showed chaos in instruments to represent strong feelings of overwhelm and fear, with heavily distorted pieces, but I found that finding the proper balance between distortion, expression, and emotion and familiarity, relatability, and visual cohesivity was more important to express my ideas. The initial idea for images 6 and 7 was to make the piece look like a tangled ball of yarn, however, it removed too many identifiable features of the french horn. After examining children's drawings of french horns, I recognized important features to retain instead

### TODO: Write tmr (make sure each point is SHORT and sweet)

#### Questions
- How has my perception of instruments changed?
- What have instruments meant to me in the past versus now?

- peace [8-9], nostalgia [10-11], enjoyment [12-13], and playfulness [14-15].

#### Research
- research children's perspective for 6-7
- research sources of nostalgia for 10-11

- experiment with recreation of intimidation, belittlement, and claustophobia in 4-5

#### Connection
- Juxtaposition
- Contrast
- Duality
- Inverse
- Antithetical

My SI displays the development of my opinions and feelings on instruments by contrasting the differences between my view and impression on instruments as a kid [1-7] - being intimidated [1-2], disgusted [3], belittled [4-5], and disoriented [6-7] - to now looking back and instead feeling peaceful [8-9], nostalgic [10-11], enjoyment [12-13], and playful [14-15]. I researched today's children's perspectives on instruments [6-7] to more accurately convey a child's mind and sources of nostalgia in order to associate guitars [10-11] with childhood memories.

Nostalgia [10-11] and enjoyment [12-13] displace disgust [3] and belittlement [4-5]. [not done]

My SI displays my development of emotions by juxtaposing my original impressions of instruments as a kid [1-7] with our eventual reconciliation [8-15]. What originally represented a blunt mess of scribbles [6-7] in my mind untangles into what resembles the playfulness of a french horn plushie [14-15]. Similarly, my habitual dedication reverses the drums' overwhelm of complexity [4-5], allowing me to harness and reframe what was chaos into what I enjoy like a pool toy [12-13]. Inverted, the series portrays my progression as a musician: mastery reduces the confrontative immediacy [1-2] into familiar intimacy [8-9] of the piano as my abilities crescendo to a forte.



My SI mirrors my transformation by juxtaposing my initial impressions of instruments [1-7] with our later reconciliation [8-15]. The plushie [14-15] untangles children's scribbles [6-7] into playful simplicity—the comfort and joy it is now. Similarly, my own progression reverses the drums untamable dominance [4-5] to my harnessing of its potential—reframing complexity as a rewarding puzzle [12-13]. Inverted, the progression portrays an instrumentalist's bidirectional journey: mastery reduces the confrontative immediacy [1-2] into familiar intimacy [8-9] of the piano as my abilities crescendo to a forte.
