"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over  time.

My sustained investigation investigates the development of my emotions on the instruments I play as I myself develop. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and sensitivity truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grow older, the very same instruments begin to hold a more sentimental and enjoyable role in my life, being a reward instead of a punishment. I investigated what caused my emotions to change over time; how it has effected how I view life, entertainment, and hard work; the duality of hatred and enjoyment; and how quickly people's opinions and emotions can change.
