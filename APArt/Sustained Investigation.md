# Sustained Investigation

## Questions that guided your sustained investigation (600 characters)

"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over time.

How has my perception of instruments changed? What have instruments meant to me in the past versus now? As a child, instruments overwhelmed me: their complexity, immensity, and sensitivity daunted me. Now, the very same instruments hold a sentimental and enjoyable role in my life—a reward, instead of a punishment. I investigate the development of my emotions on the instruments I play; my views on life, entertainment, and hard work; and the duality of hatred and enjoyment as I myself develop.

## How your sustained investigation shows evidence of practice, experimentation, and revision guided by your questions (600 characters)

### FIXED: remove title

Initially I wanted to create pieces that showed chaos in instruments to represent strong feelings of overwhelm and fear, with heavily distorted pieces, but I found that finding the proper balance between distortion, expression, and emotion and familiarity, relatability, and visual cohesivity was more important to express my ideas. The initial idea for images 6 and 7 was to make the piece look like a tangled ball of yarn, however, it removed too many identifiable features of the french horn. After examining children's drawings of french horns, I recognized important features to retain instead

### TODO: Write tmr (make sure each point is SHORT and sweet)

#### Questions
- How has my perception of instruments changed?
- What have instruments meant to me in the past versus now?

My SI displays the development of my opinions and feelings on instruments by contrasting the differences between my view and impression on instruments as a kid [1-7] - being intimidated [1-2], disgusted [3], belittled [4-5], and disoriented [6-7] - to now looking back and instead feeling peaceful [8-9], nostalgic [10-11], enjoyment [12-13], and playful [14-15]. I researched today's children's perspectives on instruments [6-7] to more accurately convey a child's mind and sources of nostalgia in order to associate guitars [10-11] with childhood memories.
