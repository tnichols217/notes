# Sustained Investigation
## Questions that guided your sustained investigation (600 characters)

"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over  time.

Why did I change my mind? My sustained investigation investigates the development of my emotions on the instruments I play as I myself develop. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and sensitivity truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grow older, the very same instruments begin to hold a more sentimental and enjoyable role in my life, being a reward instead of a punishment. I investigated how my emotions to change over time; how it has effected how I view life, entertainment, and hard work; and the duality of hatred and enjoyment.

## How your sustained investigation shows evidence of practice, experimentation, and revision guided by your questions (600 characters)

Initially I wanted to create pieces that showed the chaos of the instruments representing strong feelings of overwhelm and fear, with heavily distorted pieces, but I found that finding the proper balance between distortion, expression, and emotion and familiarity, relatability, and visual cohesivity was more important for expressing my ideas and took much more experimentation. For example, the initial idea for DAMAGED RECOLLECTIONS was to create it to look like a tangled ball of yarn, however I found that it removed too many identifiable features of the french horn.
