# Sustained Investigation

## Questions that guided your sustained investigation (600 characters)

"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over  time.

Pianos are scary! Instruments overwhelmed me as a child.

How has my view on instruments changed as I learn and mature? My SI investigates the development of my emotions on the instruments I play as I myself develop.

How has my view on instruments changed as I learn and mature? Pianos are scary! Instruments overwhelmed me as a child: their complexity, largeness, and sensitivity truly discouraged me from approaching them. Now, the very same instruments hold a sentimental and enjoyable role in my life, a reward, instead of a punishment. I investigated how my emotions changed over time; how it has affected how I view life, entertainment, and hard work; and the duality of hatred and enjoyment.

## How your sustained investigation shows evidence of practice, experimentation, and revision guided by your questions (600 characters)

### FIXED: remove title

Initially I wanted to create pieces that showed chaos in instruments to represent strong feelings of overwhelm and fear, with heavily distorted pieces, but I found that finding the proper balance between distortion, expression, and emotion and familiarity, relatability, and visual cohesivity was more important to express my ideas. The initial idea for images 6 and 7 was to make the piece look like a tangled ball of yarn, however, it removed too many identifiable features of the french horn. After examining children's drawings of french horns, I recognized important features to retain instead

### TODO: Write tmr (make sure each point is SHORT and sweet)

- research children's perspective for 6-7
- research sources of nostalgia for 10-11
- research the ickiness of natural items like moss for 1-2
- experiment with recreation of intimidation, belittlement, and claustophobia in 4-5

My SI displays the development of my opinions and feelings on instruments by contrasting the differences between my view and impression on instruments as a kid [1-7] - being intimidated [1-2], disgusted [3], belittled [4-5], and disoriented [6-7] - to now looking back and instead feeling peaceful [8-9], nostalgic [10-11], enjoyment [12-13], and playful [14-15]. I researched today's children's perspectives on instruments [6-7] to more accurately convey a child's mind and sources of nostalgia in order to associate guitars [10-11] with childhood memories.
