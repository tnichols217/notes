"Pianos are scary!" exclaimed 6 year old me. Instruments overwhelmed me as a child. Their complexity, largeness, and overall creepy vibe truly deterred me from approaching them when I was younger. As I grew up, instruments held a more sentimental and fun role in my life, being a form of entertainment. I investigated how my opinion on instruments has changed over time, from scary to fun, creating two sculptures on each instrument I played, attempting to convey my view on the instruments over  time.
