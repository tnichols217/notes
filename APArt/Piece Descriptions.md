## Materials
1. TRIPLE OVERWHELM: Blender 3D digital sculpting, handmade procedural materials, cycles render engine
2. Subserf workflow with low density topology for man-made forms and curves workflow for natural shapes

## Processes
1. Researched, experimented on, and rearranged piano parts, mechanisms, n' materials while keeping form
2. Experiment on creating materials by noticing and replicating patterns by combining distribution functions in different ways

# 2 - Guitar
## Dimensions

## Materials
1. NATURAL DISTRESS: Blender 3D, sculpted textures, and handmade procedural materials, cycles renderer
2. Initial subserf workflow, curves workflow for strings, multires sculpting for bark texture

## Processes
1. Researched qualities of guitars by surveying others on how much distortion before uncognizability
2. Experimented on scul of bark through an iterative sculpting process, refining and improving methods I know

Materials: 
Blender
Object mode to create the general shape
Recursive curves to make the strings
Sculpt mode to fine tune the shape
Displacement nodes to add shape details
Shader nodes to add color and bump

Processes: 
Looked at trees to figue out how branches are structured.
Measured a real guitar to get an idea of what size and shape to make the elements.
