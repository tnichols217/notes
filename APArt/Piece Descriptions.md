# Piece Description

## 1 - Piano

### Dimensions

Height: 3.11m
Width: 3.14m
Length: 3.67m

### Materials

1. TRIPLE OVERWHELM: Blender 3D digital sculpting, handmade procedural materials, cycles render engine
2. Subserf workflow with low density topology for man-made forms and curves workflow for natural shapes

### Processes

1. Researched, experimented on, and rearranged piano parts, mechanisms, n' materials while keeping form
2. Experiment on creating materials by noticing and replicating patterns by combining distribution functions in different ways

## 2 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 3.06m
Width: 1.48m
Length: 1.86m

### Materials

1. NATURAL DISTRESS: Blender 3D, sculpted textures, and handmade procedural materials, cycles renderer
2. Initial subserf workflow, curves workflow for strings, multires sculpting for bark texture

### Processes

1. Researched qualities of guitars by surveying others on how much distortion before uncognizability
2. Experimented on sculpting bark through iterative processes, refining and improving methods I've used

## 3 - Drums

### Dimensions

Height: 1.92m
Width: 4.77m
Length: 3.85m

### Materials

1. THE EYE OF THE KIT: Blender 3D, subserf workflow for general forms, linked geometry for optimization
2. Procedural deformation and textures for details on screws, cymbals, and legs. cycles render engine

### Processes

1. Researched types and characteristics of different drums, cymbals, and stands to create custom drums
2. Experimented on layouts of drums to maximize claustro and megalophobia while maintaining proportions

## 4 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 0.217m
Width: 0.415m
Length: 0.218m

### Materials

1. DAMAGED RECOLLECTIONS: Blender 3D, curves workflow, subserf workflow for valves, cycles renderer
2. Custom procedural denting and rust generation, procedural materials and textures, HDRI reflections

### Processes

1. Researched kid's interpretation of instruments by visiting 4 year olds and observing their drawings
2. Experimented on methods of recreating the shaky hand effect in 3D through texture, shape, and color

## 5 - Piano

### Dimensions

Height: 1.81m
Width: 4.03m
Length: 2.1m

### Materials

1. THE KEY TO SIMPLICITY - Blender 3D, nested curve workflow for strings, subserf workflow for body
2. Bevel + subserf workflow for keys for sharper look, generated distortion for wavy effect

### Processes

1. Revised from a children's toy style to a more professional yet fun look to better convey my emotion
2. Experimented with styles of generated distortion until I created one that was gentle and relaxing

## 6 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 0.0837m
Width: 0.865m
Length: 0.241m

### Materials

1. 8-BIT MEDLEY - Blender 3D, Bevel workflow for main board, buttons; subserf workflow for D-pads, head
2. Original textures: guitar strings, gray paper accent, rough paper, smudging, scratches, worn paper

### Processes

1. Researched nostalgic, fun items; settled on the NES controller, representing hours of fun in old games
2. Revised from basic clean textures to a heavily used-looking to convey a sense of an old memories

## 7 - Drum

### Dimensions

Height: 0.627m
Width: 1.69m
Length: 1.25m

### Materials

1. UNBOUND FLOW - Blender 3D, cloth simulation, subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shapes
2. Original clear plastic texture, procedurally generated waves, vertex editing to fine tune structure

### Processes

1. Experimented with methods of simulating wrinkles by varying stiffness, stretch, and starting shape
2. Revised from beach ball color scheme, and from opaque plastic to more closely follow an actual drum

## 8 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 0.149m
Width: 0.414m
Length: 0.304m

### Materials

1. Sedate resolution - Blender 3D, curves and subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shape
2. Procedurally created button weave texture; cloth and hair simulation for main stuffed body form

### Processes

1. Experimented on methods to create hair texture: procedural displacement/bump, hair simulation
2. Revised buttons to become metallic in order to reintroduce elements and textures of the french horn
