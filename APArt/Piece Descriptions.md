### Processes

1. Researched qualities of guitars by surveying others on how much distortion before uncognizability
2. Experimented on sculpting bark through iterative processes, refining and improving methods I've used

## 3 - Drums

2. Blender 3D—Procedural deformation and textures for details on screws, cymbals, legs. cycles renderer

### Processes

1. Researched types and characteristics of different drums, cymbals, and stands to create custom drums
2. Experimented on layouts of drums to maximize claustro and megalophobia by juxtaposing small chair

## 4 - Horn

Length: 9 in

### Materials

1. DISORIENTATION: Blender 3D, curves workflow, subserf workflow for valves, cycles renderer
2. Blender 3D—Custom procedural denting, rust generation, materials and textures, HDRI reflections

### Processes

1. Researched kid's interpretation of instruments by visiting 4 year olds and observing their drawings
2. Experiment recreating 3D shaky hand effect through originally created procedural distortion of shape

## 5 - Piano

### Dimensions

Height: 71 in
Width: 159 in
Length: 83 in

### Materials

1. PEACE - Blender 3D, nested curve workflow for strings, subserf workflow for body
2. Blender 3D—Bevel & subserf workflow for keys for sharper look, generated distortion for wavy effect

### Processes

1. Combined children's toy with a professional yet fun look to convey retrospective sentimentality
2. Experimented with styles of generated distortion until I created one that was gentle and relaxing

## 6 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 3 in
Width: 34 in
Length: 9 in

### Materials

1. NOSTALGIA - Blender 3D: Bevel workflow for main board, buttons; subserf wrkflow for Dpads, head
2. Blender 3D—Original textures: guitar strings, gray paper accent, smudges, scratches, rough/old paper

### Processes

1. Researched nostalgic items, settled on the NES controller due to similarities in emotion with guitar
2. Revised from basic clean textures to a heavily used-looking to convey a sense of an old memories

## 7 - Drum

### Dimensions

Height: 25 in
Width: 167 in
Length: 49 in

### Materials

1. ENJOYMENT - Blender 3D, cloth simulation, subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shapes
2. Blender 3D—Clear plastic texture, procedural generated waves, vertex editing to fine tune structure

### Processes

1. Experimented with methods of simulating wrinkles by varying stiffness, stretch, and starting shape
2. Revised from beach ball color layout to a distribution following more closely to an actual drum

## 8 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 6 in
Width: 16 in
Length: 12 in

### Materials

1. PLAYFULNESS - Blender 3D, curves and subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shape
2. Blender 3D—Procedurally created button weave texture; cloth and hair simulation

### Processes

1. Experimented on methods to create hair texture: procedural displacement/bump, hair simulation
2. Revised buttons to become metallic in order to reintroduce elements and textures of the french horn
