2. Blender 3D—Bevel & subserf workflow for keys for sharper look, generated distortion for wavy effect

### Processes

1. Combined children's toy with a professional yet fun look to convey retrospective sentimentality
2. Experimented with styles of generated distortion until I created one that was gentle and relaxing

## 6 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 0.0837m
Width: 0.865m
Length: 0.241m

### Materials

1. 8-BIT NINTENDO - Blender 3D: Bevel workflow for main board, buttons; subserf wrkflow for Dpads, head
2. Blender 3D—Original textures: guitar strings, gray paper accent, smudges, scratches, rough/old paper

### Processes

1. Researched nostalgic items, settled on the NES controller due to similarities in emotion with guitar
2. Revised from basic clean textures to a heavily used-looking to convey a sense of an old memories

## 7 - Drum

### Dimensions

Height: 0.627m
Width: 1.69m
Length: 1.25m

### Materials

1. UNBOUND FLOW - Blender 3D, cloth simulation, subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shapes
2. Blender 3D—Clear plastic texture, procedural generated waves, vertex editing to fine tune structure

### Processes

1. Experimented with methods of simulating wrinkles by varying stiffness, stretch, and starting shape
2. Revised from beach ball color layout to a distribution following more closely to an actual drum

## 8 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 0.149m
Width: 0.414m
Length: 0.304m

### Materials

1. Sedate resolution - Blender 3D, curves and subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shape
2. Blender 3D—Procedurally created button weave texture; cloth and hair simulation

### Processes

1. Experimented on methods to create hair texture: procedural displacement/bump, hair simulation
2. Revised buttons to become metallic in order to reintroduce elements and textures of the french horn
