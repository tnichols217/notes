### Processes

1. Combined children's toy with a professional yet fun look to convey retrospective sentimentality
2. Experimented with styles of generated distortion until I created one that was gentle and relaxing

### Ideas

Through my piano images, I attempted to convey the journey from intimidation to peace in my interactions with the piano. When I was younger—and physically smaller—the visual busy-ness of the piano, as well as its internal complex mechanisms both confused and scared me away from it. In the first piece, I exaggerated physical aspects of the piano that influenced my emotions the most, namely the mechanisms and keys, as well as combining it with a natural woody look to add the sense of mystery around the piano that I felt as a kid. Being older now, I view the piano from the complete opposite point of view. From both a technical understanding of how it works as well as practice on the usage of it, the complexities and scariness of the piano has been stripped away; I convey this sense of simplicity and peace with the piano through the visually simple and pleasing shape of the piano.

## 6 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 3 in
Width: 34 in
Length: 9 in

### Materials

1. NOSTALGIA - Blender 3D: Bevel workflow for main board, buttons; subserf wrkflow for Dpads, head
2. Blender 3D—Original textures: guitar strings, gray paper accent, smudges, scratches, rough/old paper

### Processes

1. Researched nostalgic fun items; settled on the NES controller, representing hrs of fun in old games
2. Revised from basic clean textures to a heavily used-looking to convey a sense of an old memories

### Ideas

My guitar pieces similarly display the journey of my relationship with the guitar. Initially, guitars invoked feelings of disgust and scariness primarily through their unwieldy shape and skin-tearing strings. In the first piece, I represent the hostility of the guitar through the barbed wires as well as the morphing of its shape into a dead tree to emphasize its scariness and disgust to me as a child. On the other end of the spectrum, the guitar now holds a sentimental and nostalgic place in my memories. Guitars no longer scare nor disgust me but instead offer a way of escape and enjoyment—much like old games for many. My enjoyment of the guitar is directly represented in the shape of the controller for the classic Nintendo NES—invoking both satisfaction and nostalgia in its viewers.

## 7 - Drum

### Dimensions

Height: 25 in
Width: 167 in
Length: 49 in

### Materials

1. ENJOYMENT - Blender 3D, cloth simulation, subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shapes
2. Blender 3D—Clear plastic texture, procedural generated waves, vertex editing to fine tune structure

### Processes

1. Experimented with methods of simulating wrinkles by varying stiffness, stretch, and starting shape
2. Revised from beach ball color layout to a distribution following more closely to an actual drum

### Ideas

I first began learning the drums when I was much younger. The size disparity between me and the drums was... let's say greater than optimal. Not only were the drums physically much larger than me, they were probably also much louder. As fun as they were even as a kid, they still scared me on some level—like how ants probably feel that at any time a human could come and crush them. In my piece I completely exaggerated the size and quantity of the drums to convey the sense of belittlement and overwhelm I felt as a kid. Now that the drums are not multiple times larger than me, I no longer feel their dominance nor its claustrophobic and megalophobic effect on me. The only emotions that are left are those of fun and enjoyment—just like the unending hours of fun children have in the pool. I express the sense of fun and enjoyment through a representation of the drums as a pool float, and utilize subtle waves, much like the piano, to further calm the situation down from the first overwhelming piece.

## 8 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 6 in
Width: 16 in
Length: 12 in

### Materials

1. PLAYFULNESS - Blender 3D, curves and subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shape
2. Blender 3D—Procedurally created button weave texture; cloth and hair simulation

### Processes

1. Experimented on methods to create hair texture: procedural displacement/bump, hair simulation
2. Revised buttons to become metallic in order to reintroduce elements and textures of the french horn

### Ideas

The french horn was the last instrument I began learning out of the instruments in this portfolio. My first experience with the french horn consisted mostly of me attempting the trace the path of the air through the instrument, but failing miserably particularly around the valves. Not much about the french horn made sense other than you blow into it and it makes sound. By showing little children a french horn and asking them to draw it from memory, most of them managed to scribble a roughly circular shape although with a clear input and a large bell on the other side. I also noticed that they drew the bell in the middle of the instrument instead of the bottom where it belongs. I tried to incorporate the feelings of confusion and disorientation a child's scribbles invokes by applying it to my french horn where I underwent similar feelings. After much more experience on the french horn, I managed to demystify its secrets and untangle its knots. On a similar theme, I wanted to show the polarity between a child's scribbles and their play with plushies—something children can alternate between at incredible speeds. The plushie of a french horn instead aims to invoke the playfulness and resolution I feel for the horn now instead of its prior confusion.
