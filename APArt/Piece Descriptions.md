## 5 - Piano

### Dimensions

Height: 71 in
Width: 159 in
Length: 83 in

### Materials

1. PEACE - Blender 3D, nested curve workflow for strings, subserf workflow for body
2. Blender 3D—Bevel & subserf workflow for keys for sharper look, generated distortion for wavy effect

### Processes

1. Combined children's toy with a professional yet fun look to convey retrospective sentimentality
2. Experimented with styles of generated distortion until I created one that was gentle and relaxing

### Ideas

Through my piano images, I attempted to convey the journey from intimidation to peace in my interactions with the piano. When I was younger—and physically smaller—the visual busy-ness of the piano, as well as its internal complex mechanisms both confused and scared me away from it. In the first piece, I exaggerated physical aspects of the piano that influenced my emotions the most, namely the mechanisms and keys, as well as combining it with a natural woody look to add the sense of mystery around the piano that I felt as a kid. Being older now, I view the piano from the complete opposite point of view. From both a technical understanding of how it works as well as practice on the usage of it, the complexities and scariness of the piano has been stripped away; I convey this sense of simplicity and peace with the piano through the visually simple and pleasing shape of the piano.

## 6 - Guitar

### Dimensions

Height: 3 in
Width: 34 in
Length: 9 in

### Materials

1. NOSTALGIA - Blender 3D: Bevel workflow for main board, buttons; subserf wrkflow for Dpads, head
2. Blender 3D—Original textures: guitar strings, gray paper accent, smudges, scratches, rough/old paper

### Processes

1. Researched nostalgic fun items; settled on the NES controller, representing hrs of fun in old games
2. Revised from basic clean textures to a heavily used-looking to convey a sense of an old memories

### Ideas

My guitar pieces similarly display the journey of my relationship with the guitar. Initially, guitars invoked feelings of disgust and scaredness primarily through their unwieldy shape and skin-tearing strings. Through yhe

2. Blender 3D—Clear plastic texture, procedural generated waves, vertex editing to fine tune structure

### Processes

1. Experimented with methods of simulating wrinkles by varying stiffness, stretch, and starting shape
2. Revised from beach ball color layout to a distribution following more closely to an actual drum

## 8 - Horn

### Dimensions

Height: 6 in
Width: 16 in
Length: 12 in

### Materials

1. PLAYFULNESS - Blender 3D, curves and subserf workflow for generating initial cloth shape
