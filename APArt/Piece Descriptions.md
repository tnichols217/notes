## Materials
1. TRIPLE OVERWHELM: Blender 3D digital sculpting, handmade procedural materials, cycles render engine
2. Subserf workflow with low density topology for man-made forms and curves workflow for natural shapes

## Processes
1. Researched, experimented on, and rearranged piano parts, mechanisms, n' materials while keeping form
2. Experiment on creating materials by noticing and replicating patterns by combining distribution functions in different ways

## Materials
1. NATURAL DISTRESS: Blender 3D, sculpted textures, and handmade procedural materials, cycles renderer
2. Initial subserf workflow, curves workflow for strings, multires sculpting for bark texture

## Processes
1. Researched qualities of guitars by surveying others on how much distortion before uncognizability
2. Experimented on sculpting bark through iterative processes, refining and improving methods I've used
