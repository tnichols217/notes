## Materials
1. TRIPLE OVERWHELM: Blender 3D digital sculpting, handmade procedural materials, cycles render engine
2. Subserf workflow with low density topology for man-made forms and curves workflow for natural shapes

## Processes
1. Researched, experimented on, and rearranged piano parts, mechanisms, n' materials while keeping form
2. Experiment on creation of realistic wood, metal, and rust materials and use of natural curves
