# Probability Inequalities

## Chebychev's Inequality

Let $X$ be a random variable and let $g(x)$ be a non-negative function. Then, for any $r>0$

$P(g(X)\ge r)\le \frac{Eg(X)}{r}$

## Normal Probability Inequality

With $Z$ as a normal distribution,

$P(|Z|\ge t)\le\sqrt{\frac{e}{\pi}}\frac{e^{-t^2/2}}{t}$ for all $t>0$
