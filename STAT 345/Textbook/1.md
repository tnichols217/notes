# Probability Theory

## Set Theory

> [!def]
> **Sample Space**
> All possible outcomes of a variable, often denoted as **$S$**

Finite sample spaces can be denoted with all elements inside a list enclosed by curly braces.
$S=\{H,T\}$ for the sample space of flipping a coin

> [!def]
> **Event**
> An event is a group of possible outcomes which are a subset of $S$. Often probabilities are calculated by the event and not just an element of S
> 
> $A\subset S\iff x\in A \implies x\in S$

### Set Symbols and operators
#### Set
A collection of elements, denoted by a list inside curly braces
$\{1, 2, 3\}$

#### Union
Combining two sets together, uses the symbol $\cup$
$\{1,2,3\}\cup\{3,4,5\}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

#### Intersection
The set with elements that are part of the two intersecting sets. Uses the symbol $\cap$
$\{1,2,3\}\cap\{3,4,5\}=\{3\}$

#### Subset
A statement that all of one set's elements are part of another set's elements. Uses the symbol $\subset$
$\{3\}\subset\{3,4,5\}$
