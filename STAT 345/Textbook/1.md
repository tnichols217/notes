# Probability Theory

## Set Theory

> [!def]
> **Sample Space**
> All possible outcomes of a variable, often denoted as **$S$**

Finite sample spaces can be denoted with all elements inside a list enclosed by curly braces.
$S=\{H,T\}$ for the sample space of flipping a coin

> [!def]
> **Event**
> An event is a group of possible outcomes which are a subset of $S$. Often probabilities are calculated by the event and not just an element of S
> 
> $A\subset S\iff x\in A \implies x\in S$

### Set Symbols and operators
#### Set
A collection of elements, denoted by a list inside curly braces
$\{1, 2, 3\}$

#### Union
Combining two sets together, uses the symbol $\cup$
