# Probability Theory

## Set Theory

> [!def]
> **Sample Space**
> All possible outcomes of a variable, often denoted as **$S$**

Finite sample spaces can be denoted with all elements inside a list enclosed by curly braces.
$S=\{H,T\}$ for the sample space of flipping a coin

> [!def]
> **Event**
> An event is a group of possible outcomes which are a subset of $S$. Often probabilities are calculated by the event and not just an element of S
>
> $A\subset S\iff x\in A \implies x\in S$

### Set Symbols and operators

#### Set $\{\}$

A collection of elements
$\{1, 2, 3\}$

#### Union $\cup$

Combining two sets together
$\{1,2,3\}\cup\{3,4,5\}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

#### Intersection $\cap$

The set with elements that are part of the two intersecting sets
$\{1,2,3\}\cap\{3,4,5\}=\{3\}$

#### Subset $\subset$

A statement that all of one set's elements are part of another set's elements
$\{3,4\}\subset\{3,4,5\}$

#### Not Subset $\not\subset$

The opposite of a subset, pretty self explanatory
$\{3,6\}\not\subset\{3,4,5\}$

#### Superset $\supset$

All of $B$'s elements are at least contained in $A$
$\{3,4,5\}\supset\{3,4\}$

#### Not Superset $\not\supset$

Not a superset
$\{3,4,5\}\not\supset\{3,6\}$

#### Complement $A^C$

All the elements that are not in A in the area of interest. Symbolized with $C$ in the superscript
$\{1,3,5\}^C=\{2,4,6\}$ where $\mathbb{U}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

#### Difference $\setminus$

Whatever is in A but not in B. Uses $\setminus$.
$\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\setminus\{3,4\}=\{1,2,5,6\}$

#### Element of $\in$

Represents that an element is inside a set
$2\in\{1,2,3\}$

#### Not element of $\notin$

An element is not part of a set
$4\notin\{1,2,3\}$

#### Empty Set $\varnothing$

Represents $\{\}$

#### Sigma Algebra $\sigma$

A set of sets $B$ that
1. Contains $\varnothing$
2. If $A\in B$, then $A^C\in B$
3. If $A_1,A_2,A_3,...\in B$ then $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\in B$

It is also a subset of the Power set of $A$

#### Power Set $\textbf{P}$

The set of every possible subset of A
$P(\{1,2\})=\{\{\},\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$

### Common named sets

#### Universal Set $\mathbb{U}$

The set of every possible value of interest

#### Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$

Every Positive integer
$\{0,1,2,3,...\}$

#### Integers $\mathbb{Z}$

Every number that does not have a decimal component
$\{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}$

#### Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$

Any fraction
$\{1, 0.12, 232.1,...\}$

#### Algebraic Numbers $\mathbb{A}$

Any complex number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable, with rational coefficients.
$\{-\sqrt{2},3.18,i,...\}$

#### Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$
All Integers, Rational numbers, and Irrational numbers
$\{3,3.124,\pi\}$

#### Imaginary Numbers $\mathbb{I}$
The square root of any negative number
$\{i,2i,\pi i,...\}$

#### Complex Numbers $\mathbb{C}$
The sum of any $\mathbb{R}$eal number and $\mathbb{I}$maginary number
$\{1+i,i,1,...\}$
