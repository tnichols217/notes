# Probability Theory

## Set Theory

> [!def]
> **Sample Space**
> All possible outcomes of a variable, often denoted as **$S$**

Finite sample spaces can be denoted with all elements inside a list enclosed by curly braces.
$S=\{H,T\}$ for the sample space of flipping a coin

> [!def]
> **Event**
> An event is a group of possible outcomes which are a subset of $S$. Often probabilities are calculated by the event and not just an element of S
> 
> $A\subset S\iff x\in A \implies x\in S$

### Set Symbols and operators
#### Set $\{\}$
A collection of elements
$\{1, 2, 3\}$

#### Union $\cup$
Combining two sets together
$\{1,2,3\}\cup\{3,4,5\}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$

#### Intersection $\cap$
The set with elements that are part of the two intersecting sets
$\{1,2,3\}\cap\{3,4,5\}=\{3\}$

#### Subset $\subset$
A statement that all of one set's elements are part of another set's elements
$\{3,4\}\subset\{3,4,5\}$

#### Not Subset $\not\subset$
The opposite of a subset, pretty self explanatory
$\{3,6\}\not\subset\{3,4,5\}$

#### Superset $\supset$
All of $B$'s elements are at least contained in $A$
$\{3,4,5\}\supset\{3,4\}$

#### Not Superset $\not\supset$
Not a superset
$\{3,4,5\}\not\supset\{3,6\}$

#### Complement $A^C$
All the elements that are not in A in the area of interest. Symbolized with $C$ in the superscript
$\{1,3,5\}^C=\{2,4,6\}$ where $\mathbb{U}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

#### Difference $\setminus$
Whatever is in A but not in B. Uses $\setminus$.
$\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\setminus\{3,4\}=\{1,2,5,6\}$

#### Element of $\in$
Represents that an element is inside a set
$2\in\{1,2,3\}$

#### Not element of $\notin$
An element is not part of a set
$4\notin\{1,2,3\}$

#### Empty Set $\varnothing$
Represents $\{\}$
