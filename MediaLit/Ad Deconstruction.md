## Description
This is a very simple ad from Jeep, with a car driving off of a circle on the right side into nothing. The entire background is a minty green. There is a small description on the bottom left talking about how we need to save the planet (ironic for a car company).

## Techniques of Persuasion
This ad uses a lot of empty space of the color green to portray cleanliness and ecofriendliness, being green. It attempts to communicate that Jeep (a car company) cares for the environment in its cars by being eco-friendly. Although gas cars (especially trucks like Jeeps) are big pollutants, Jeep is trying to convince the audience that Jeeps don't pollute, which if correctly persuades the customer, would directly pollute more ironically.

## Techno-Effects and Subliminal Images
This scene makes use of a lot of empty space, being plain green. The camera angle is a straight on shot from the side of the car, giving a very simplistic view for the entire scene. There is no lighting, there is no depth, there is no 3D, it is a simplistic 2D piece attempting to portray the cleanliness of the Jeep and how it helps the earth.
