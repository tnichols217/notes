## Description
This is a very simple ad from Jeep, with a car driving off of a circle on the right side into nothing. The entire background is a minty green. There is a small description on the bottom left talking about how we need to save the planet (ironic for a car company).

## Techniques of Persuasion
This ad uses a lot of empty space of the color green to portray cleanliness and ecofriendliness, being green. It attempts to communicate that Jeep (a car company) cares for the environment in its cars by being eco-friendly. Although gas cars (especially trucks like Jeeps) are big pollutants, Jeep is trying to convince the audience that Jeeps don't pollute, which if correctly persuades the customer, would directly pollute more ironically.

## Techno-Effects and Subliminal Images
This scene makes use of a lot of empty space, being plain green. The camera angle is a straight on shot from the side of the car, giving a very simplistic view for the entire scene. There is no lighting, there is no depth, there is no 3D, it is a simplistic 2D piece attempting to portray the cleanliness of the Jeep and how it helps the earth.

## Emotions and the Story
It is trying to make you feel bad for the Earth, with the "problem" that is is dying, and their "solution" is to buy a Jeep because it is more eco-friendly, while the real "cure" is to not drive a car. (reference to poison, cure, medication meme). The ad is trying to make you associate jeep with "green" a symbol of cleanliness, by making majority of the ad green and simplistically clean. The logic is that if you get a Jeep, you'll be saving the planet because you won't be polluting as much.

## Intended and Unintended Effects
There are only three colors in this ad: white, black, and the green background. It draws you to the accent color, black, as white is more prevalent in this image. The centrality of the car falling off a circle representing the planet, draws the readers attention straight to the truck, making us wonder why it is falling off a circle. Then we understand that Jeeps save the planet. One unintended effect is that I associated black with uncleanliness, while the ad was designed to be sleek and clean representing eco-friendliness, the Jeep was black, a stain to the advertisement, something I associated with a problem of the planet.

## Marketing Strategy
They are trying to make you associate Jeep with being green and good for the environment. It is running in response to many people's understanding that cars pollute and hurt the environment. This is an effort to turn that intuition on its head by feeding propaganda that Jeep cars really can be good for the environment and the planet. They want you to associated being good for the environment with buying a Jeep. The target audience is more for people who care a little bit for the environment, but not too much because if you really cared you'd know that trucks cannot be good for the environment at all and there are much better solutions. In the case of the person who doesn't really care that much for the environment, the ad attempts to convince you that you are are bad person and you really should care for the Earth, and to do that, buy a Jeep.

## Overall Impressions
I hate trucks. I hate big un-shared low occupancy vehicles, including Jeeps. I dislike them because they take up space, cause traffic, waste energy, and pollute a lot. Although the ad attempts to try and make me associate Jeep with clean, it fails miserably because I already understand that is his propaganda to try and make me think that Jeeps can be clean. If you wanted to be clean go get a properly made bicycle. It tries to sell that being clean is cool and good, and that buying a Jeep accomplishes that. No, there isn't enough information to make an informed buying decision, but then again they don't want you to because if you saw the emissions from that thing their ad wouldn't hold water.

## My Own Questions
1. Why would you use black for the Jeep, it appears unclean?

	> Because it highlights the Jeep and planet, because it becomes the accent color due to being so little of it.

2. Why did you make the "planet" bumpy, it makes it look unclean?

	> Because we are trying to pull in a piece of Jeep, by showing its off-road capabilities and its natural habitat. Additionally it symbolizes the dirtiness of the planet that buying a Jeep would solve.

3. Why is the Jeep and the planet slightly off center?

	> Since it is slightly off center, it brings your eyes to it, making you wonder what it is, improving the visibility of the Jeep side profile.
