# The Origin of Life
## Earlier Ideas
### Spontaneous Generation
- Living things could come from non-living things
- Francesco Redi designed an experiment to test this
	- Two jars: one without a lid and one with
	- Both had food inside (theorized to be able to spontaneously generate)
	- The one without a lid had flies coming out of the food, and the one with the lid did not
- Louis Pasteur designed an experiment to test this on microorganisms as well
	- Two jars, both with a bend in the neck

	- The jars had a broth inside and were boiled to kill all the microorganisms inside
	- The bend in the neck collected condensation and sealed the broth off from outside
	- One jar had the neck broken so that fresh air could enter
	- The jar with the broken neck's broth turned cloudy after some time, while the other did not
	  
	| Broken Neck                            | Sealed Neck                                                    |

	| Fresh air could reach the broth        | Broth was sealed from the outside world                        |

	| Microorganisms grew in the broth       | Broth remained sterile and no microorganisms were found inside |
