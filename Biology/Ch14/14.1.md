## Types of Fossil Types
| Trace Fossil                                    | Molds and casts                                    | Replacement                                | Petrified                                 | Amber                                       | Original Material                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Any indirect material thats left by an organism | An impression in rock, may be filled with sediment | Original Material is replaced with crystal | Empty pore spaces are filled with crystal | The whole organism is preserved in tree sap | Mummification or freezing preserves the material |
