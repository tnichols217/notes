# The cell cycle
Once the cell reaches its limit, it stops growing and starts dividing because it is necessary for
- growth
- healing
- development

This process is called the cell cycle, consists of **Interphase and Mitosis**

- Cells can only be duplicated, the cell split is the same as the other cell
## Cellular Interphase
- The cell grows, carries out cellular functions, makes copies of its DNA
- Split into 3 stages
- G stands for gap, S stands for synthesis
### Steps of Cellular Interphase
1. #### $G_1$ - Gap 1
	- Cell grows, carries out normal functions
	- Prepares to replicate DNA
	- Some cells may exit at this stage and never replicate (nerve cells and muscle cells...)
	- Centrioles move to opposites of the cell
2. #### $S$ - Synthesis
	- DNA synthesis
	- Call copies DNA in proeparation for cell devision
	- Chromatin is replicated
3. #### $G_2$ - Gap 2
	- Cell prepares for nuclear division
	- Makes microtubules needed for division
	- Ensures everything is ready to divide

## Cellular Mitotic Phase
### Steps of the Mitotic Phase
1. Mitosis
	- cell's nucleus and nuclear materal divides
	- divided into atleast 4 sub-stages
2. Cytokinesis
	- Division of the cell's cytoplasm

#### Mitosis

##### Steps (PMAT)
1. ###### Prophase
	1. Nucleus is still there
	2. Chromosomes are condensing from the DNA
	3. DNA gets **shorter** and **thicker**
2. ###### Prometaphase (sometimes considered part of the metaphase)
	1. Nucleus membrance disappears
	2. Formation of microtubules
		1. Attach to the chromosomes (centrometer of it)
3. ###### Metaphase (Middle)
	1. Chromosomes line up to the middle of the cell
4. ###### Anaphase (Away)
	1. Chromosomes split (chromatins separate)
	2. The chromosomes move away from the center to the edges of the cell
	3. The spindles (microtubules) help pull them to the edges
5. ###### Telophase (Two)
	1. Chromosomes reach the poles
	2. Two new neuclei are formed
	3. Microtubules disappears

#### Cytokinesis
- The cytoplasm splits and two cells are separated.
- This part is **not** considered part of Mitosis
