# Cell Cycle Regulation
- Two different molecules regulate whether or not a cell undergoes mitosis
	- **Cyclins** (proteins)
	- **Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)** (proteins that need cyclins to keep producing)
- In **G1**, **cyclin and CDKs** signal the beginning of the cycle
- This allows regulation of how frequent the cell will undergo mitosis
- There are many checkpoints throughout the cycle, need the protein there to continue in the cycle
- Both CDK and cyclin is needed to continue the cycle, without one, it cannot continue

## Checkpoints
> There are multiple checkpoints throughout the cycle to ensure that the cell division is proper and sucessful
### $G_1$ Checkpoint
- Checks for 
	- size
	- nutrients
	- growth factors
	- DNA damage
- Happens before $G_1$, before the beginning of the cycle
### $G_2$ Checkpoint
- Checks for
	- DNA damage (after replication)
	- DNA replication completeness
- Happens after $S$ to check if DNA synthesis is good and complete
### Spindle (Metaphase) Checkpoint
- Checks for
	- All spindles are attached to the chromosomes
- Makes sure all the DNA is present in both cells

## Cell death
- When something is wrong with the cell cycle or just the cell, it needs to be removed.
- This process is called **Apoptosis**
- This only happens when the cell is **beyond repair**
- May lead to cancer is apoptosis is not executed properly
### Steps
1. Something is detected as wrong
2. Begins Apoptosis
3. Cells shrink and shrivel
	1. Digested by Lysosomes in a controlled process
4. The cell is split up into smaller pieces
5. White blood cells take and reuse the discarded pieces

### Other uses for Apoptosis
- Removal of tissues like tails in tadpoles
- Organ sculpting
- Removing the skin between fingers when humans are being birthed
