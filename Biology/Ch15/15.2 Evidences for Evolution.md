## Support for Evolution

### Fossil records
- There should be intermediaries between species to show the evolution somewhere in the fossil record
- Archaeopteryx fossils provide evidence of characteristics that classify it as a bird, and also show that the bird retained several distinct dinosaur features.
- Many old extinct species look similar to the ones we have today, with minor modifications or size changes

### Comparative anatomy

| Type of Structure         | Meaning                                                                               | Evolutionist's Interpretation                                                       | Creationist's Interpretation                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Homologous Structures** | Similar structures across organisms, but serve different functions                    | many organisms have similar structures, meaning they evolved from a common ancestor | it has a common designer and they are still all unique |
| **Vestigial structures**  | Structues similar to other organisms that are nonfunctional or without purpose        | its because they evolved past the need of them                                      | its because we dont know what they are for yet         |
| **Analogous structures**  | Structures that are for the same purpose but are not inherited from a common ancestor | they share a common ancestor, but developed wings separately                        | they were created differently                          |

### Comparative Embryology

- Vertebrate embryos have homologous structures during certain early phases of development 

| Evolutionist                                                      | Creationist                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The similarities in the embryo show how they have common ancestry | The similar looks are only temporary as when the species mature, the similarities disappear |

### Comparative Biochemistry

- The closer related species are, certain chemicals in their body should be similar
- A certain molecule, Cytochrome-c, is very similar in humans, moneys, and horses
- Cytochrome-c is a sequence of 112 amino acids, 19 are the same across all organisms

| Evolutionist                                                                                 | Creationist                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This is because they share ancestors and evolved to have differences due to random mutations | 19 amino acids still remain unchanged after supposed changes to over 5000 genes, how is this possible |

### Geographic Distribution
- Species closer to each other tend to have similar features 

| Evolutionist                                     | Creationist                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| This is because they evolved and migrated slowly | This can be explained by the flood |

## Adaptation

> [!def]
> **Fitness**: a measure of the relative contribution an individual trait makes to the next generation (how much the next generation has a trait)

### Types of Morphological Adaptations
- Things adapt to their environment
- They then have a higher chance of surviving

#### Camoflage
![[Pasted image 20220323113354.png]]
- Allows organisms to blend in
- Makes it hard for predators to find them

#### Mimicry
![[Pasted image 20220323113421.png]]
- A species adapts to look like another species
- Often a harmless species evolves to look like a dangerous species
- Predators will avoid them

#### Antimicrobial Resistance
- Bacteria that has evolved to be able to survive antibiotics, like penicillin


### Consequences of Adaptations
#### Spandrel Example
- Spandrels are very decorative and prominent, leading people to believe they exist for decoration
	- Spandrels are a necessary side effect of arches, a structural support
- Some features in organisms might be spandrels
	- Even though they stand out, they may not be necessary for reproductive success
	- They may be a necessary side effect of earlier evolution

#### Human Example
- Humans are born a lot earlier than other primates
- Thought to be so that humans can be smarter to have better reproductive fitness
- Really is just because we have big brains and an upright posture, so we need to be born sooner to fit through the pelvic opening

## Evolutionist vs Creationist

| Evolutionist                    | Creationist                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Vertical Change                 | Horizontal Variation                                 |
| Change inherited from ancestors | Created with differences, and inherits minor changes |
| New Species come from old ones  | New species are just variations of old ones          |
