# Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection

> [!info] Story
> Darwin was a natuyralist who was on a voyage to collect specimens focused on south America.
> It took 5 years.
> He noticed that there were fossils of marine life high in the mountains.
> He found giant fossil versions of smaller living animals.
> He notices how earthquakes can lift rocks far and quickly.
> There was a great variety of life on the Galagapos Islands.
> Theorized that they migrated from the mainland to the islands.
> Then they developed different beaks.
> Darwin returned, had a conversation and hypothesized on why this happens.

> **Artificial Selection**: Something intelligently chooses desirable traits, in hopes that offspring will have those traits.

> [!def]
> **Natural Selection**: Over time, organisms will adapt to their environment.

> Requirements:
> 1. Variation - They differ from each other
> 2. Heritability - Variations are inherited
> 3. Overproduction - Too many of a species, so they much compete to survive
> 4. Reproductive advantage - Have a higher chance of reproducing and living given the circumstances.
