5 # Shaping Evolutionary Theory
## Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
> [!def]
> A population's allele and genotype frequencies are constant
> 
> ### $p+q = 1$
> - where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele and $q$ is for the recessive
> 
> Held true unless there is some type of evolutionary force acting upon them
> 
> Requirements:
> 1. No Selection
> 2. No Mutation
> 3. No Migration
> 4. Large Population
> 5. Random Mating
> 
> Can be expanded to genotypes as well
> 
> ### $p^2+ 2pq + q^2 = 1$
> 

- If the requirements for Hardy-Weinberd equilibrium are held, then there will be 
	- Genetic equilibrium
	- No evolution

## Mechanisms of Evolution
### Genetic Drift
> [!def]
> Changes in allelic frequency due to chance
> Most commonly attributed to lack of population size
- Genetic Diversity is lost, leading to a change in the allelic frequencies
- Random chance makes a big change when the population is small because a single change effects the frequency of the entire population on a larger scale
	- Ex: If you have 50 black beetles and 50 brown beetles
		- If one black beetle dies, the ratio is still $49:50$ or $4.9:5$ beetles
	- If there were 5 black beetles and 5 brown beetles
		- Although the Initial ratio is the same, $1:1$, a change would greatly change the ratios
		- If one black one died, the ratio becomes $40:50$ or $4:5$

#### Bottleneck effect
![[Pasted image 20220323113532.png]]
- Occurs when a population shrinks to a small size, then rebounds
- Random chance effects the frequencies, and when it rebounds, the frequencies are stuck different

#### Founder effect
- A group moves out to start their own population and are separate from the previous population
- Since the group moving out tends to be small, random chance has great effect, leading to genetic drift

### Gene Flow
> [!def]
> Transfer or alleles or genes from one population to another
- Caused by migration

### Non-random Mating
> [!def]
> When mating is not completely random.
- Causes include:
	- Visual stimulation
	- Sounds
	- Smells
	- Strength

### Mutations
> [!def]
> Random change in genetic Material
- Happens completely randomly
- Happens in Eukaryotes on average 0.003 per genome per generation
- Typical Gene mutates on average once every 1000 cell divisions

### Natural Selection
> [!def]
> Nature selects the individuals best adapted for survival and reproduction by their allele
Types:
1. Stabilizing Selection
	- Eliminates extremes of a trait and the average trait leads to higher fitness
2. Directional Selection
	- Where one extreme is selected for, leading to keep going in the extreme direction
3. Disruptive Selection
	- Either extreme is favored
4. Sexual Selection
	- Acts on an organism's ability to find and mate

## Reproductive Isolation
### Prezygotic isolation
> [!def]
> Prevents reproduction by making fertilization unlikely
- Includes:
	- Geographic behaviors
	- Ecological Differences
	- Time of mating
### Postzygotic isolation
> [!def]
> Can't develop offspring
- Examples Include:
	- Liger
	- Mule

## Speciation
> [!def]
> When a population diverges and then be reproductively isolated.
### Types of speciation
![[Pasted image 20220323113926.png]]
#### Allopatric Speciation
> [!def]
> A new species forms because a physical barrier separates a population into multiple parts
- Believed to be the most common type of speciation
- Can be caused by rivers, mountains, etc.
#### Sympatic Speciation
> [!def]
> A new species develops from another without a physical barrier
- most common in plants through **polyploidy** (change in chromosome number) impacts a plantâ€™s ability to breed with the present type

### Rate of speciation
#### Gradualism
> [!def]
> Specization that happens in small gradual steps
#### Punctuated Equilibrium
> [!def]
> Rapid spurts of genetic change cause species to diverge quickly

## Patterns of Evolution
![[Pasted image 20220323113946.png]]
### Adaptive Radiation (Divergent)
> [!def]
> One species gives rise to many species in response to the creation of a new habitat or other ecological opportunity
- Can be
	- Birds evolving to have different colors or songs
	- Fishes evolving colors
### Coevolution
> [!def]
> Species evolve in close relationship to one another
- Includes Mutualism, Parasitism
- Examples include:
	- Orchids and moths
		- Orchids will grow longer to increase the spread of pollen
		- Moths will grow longer to get more nectar
### Convergent Evolution
> [!def]
> Unrelated species evolve similar traits even though they live in different parts of the world
- Could be:
	- Sugar glider and flying squirrel
