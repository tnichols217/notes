1. What are the phases of Mitosis
	- PMAT (no cytokinesis or interphase)
2. Why is the S stage in interphase called synthesis?
	- Because the DNA gets synthesysed (produced) in this set

3. What is in the middle?
	- Centromere

4. What are the processes happening in the picture
	- Meiosis and Fertilization
5. When does DNA crossover?
	- In Metaphase 1 in Meiosis when the homologous chromosomes are all lined up in pairs

6. What phase happens after the stage shown in the picture
	- Prophase 1
So the next step is prophase
7. What regulates the cell cycle?
	- Cyclins
8. What doesn’t happen during prophase
	- Chromosomes line up in the center
9. If a cell mitosis without cytokinesis what happens
	- Cancerous properties (X)
	- Multiple nuclei
10. What causes cancer
	- (uncontrolled) growth rate
11. What doesn’t happen as the cell size increases?
	- Surface area to volume ratio increases (it actually decreases)
12. When does a cell go from haploid to diploid
	- (Anaphase I) or when the homologous chromosomes get pulled apart
13. Where or when does the chromosome split? (anaphase, in the middle)
	- When homologous pairs line up and get pulled apart (metaphase/anaphase I)
14. Centrioles - source of spindle fibers (NOT CENTROMERES)
