# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- **Hyphae**- Strings that make up the basic shape and structure
- **Mycelium**- Netlike mass of hyphae (underground)
- **Fruiting body**- Reproductive structure (visible to us above ground)
- **Cross walls**- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
	- Have hole to allow transport along th hyphae

## Nutrition
- **Saprophytic**: Decomposers that recycle nutrients
- **Parasitic**: Absorb nutrients from the living cells of hosts
-  **Mutualistic**: Work with another organism to help each other out

## Reproduction
- **Budding**: Asexual reproduction where a daughter cell grows while attached to the parent cell
- **Fragmentation**: The mycelium gets disconnected, creating two
- **Spore Reproduction**: Asexual and sexual where a spore(haploid) is created and can continue to mature into a hyphae without gamettes.
	- May have sporangium (a case to protect the spore)
	- Relies on quality over probability of reproducing
	- Lightweight so they can fly away

## Types
- **Chytrids** (Chytridiomycota)
	- Aquatic
	- Some paracitic
	- Have Flagellated spores
- **Common mold** (Zygomycota)
	- Mostly terrestrial
	- Some are mutualistic
	- Form hyphae called **stolons**
	- Hyphae **rhizoids** penetrate the food
	- Produce asexually (**sporangia**) or sexually (**gametangium**)
- **Sac Fungi** (Ascomycota)
	- Yeast is the only unicellular
	- Reproduce asexually through spores then sexually
- **Club Fungi** (Basidiomycota)
	- Includes mushrooms
	- Can be paracitic, mutualistic, or Saprophyic
	- Decompose wood
	- Mostly sexual reproduction through its **basidiocarp**
- **Imperfect fungi** (Deuteromycota)
	- Sexual reproduction has never been observed

## Uses
- **Lichen**: symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae
- **Mycorrhizae**: mutualistic relationship between a specialized fungus and plant roots
- **Decomposers**
- **Medicinal**: Penicillin
- **Foods**: Mushrooms, cheese
-  **Kill** plants
-  **Parasitize**: athletes foot, ringworm, yeast infections
