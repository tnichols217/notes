# Bacteria

## Prokaryotes
- Microscopic
- Unicellular
- Circular DNA
- Some have a capsule
	- Helps protect cell
	- Prevents drying out
	- Helps attach to other cells
- Some have *pili* (hair)

## Identification

### Movement
````col
```col-md
#### Flagellum
- Use a whip shaped tail to move around
- Tend to want to move towards light and oxygen
	- or amino acids and sugar
```
```col-md
#### Stationary
- cant move
```
````

### Metabolism
#### Food Production
````col
```col-md
##### Photoautotrophs
- Exercise photosynthesis
- Use sunlight as main source of energy
```
```col-md
##### Chemoautotrophs
- Make energy by breaking down organic compounds
- Cant use sunlight
- Energy is from oxidation
```
````
#### Oxygen
````col
```col-md
##### Aerobes
- Respirates aerobically
- More effecient
- Uses Oxygen
```
```col-md
##### Anaerobes
- Respirates anaerobically
- Less effecient
- Does not requre Oxygen
```

## Reproduction
### Binary Fission
> [!def] Binary Fission
> 
> **Binary Fission**: Division by getting larger then separating into two identical cells.
- Similar to cell division
- Can happen as fast as in 20 minutes

### Conjugation
> [!def] Conjugation
> 
> **Conjugation**: Two cells attach and exchange genetic information
- increases genetic diversity

## Functionality
