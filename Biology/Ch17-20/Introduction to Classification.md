# Classification
> [!def]
> **Classification (taxonomy)**: arrangement of organisms into orderly groups based on their similarities
> 
> **Taxonomists**: scientists that identify and name organisms

## Early Methods of Taxonomy
### Aristotle's System
- Aristotle is believed to be the first taxonomist
- He classified living things first as plants or animals, it looks something like:

> [!info] Aristotle's system
> - Animal
> 	- Bloodless (Invertebrates)
> 		- Land
> 		- Water
> 		- Air
> 	- Blodded (Vertebrates)
> 		- Land
> 		- Water
> 		- Air
> - Plant
> 	- Herbs
> 	- Shrubs
> 	- Trees

#### Criticisms of Aristotle's System
- Aristotle's system was good for categorizing, but did not account for evolutionary relationships
- Some organisms did not fit well into this system

### John Ray's System
- Was a botanist
- **First person to use Latin** for naming
- The names were very long as specific

### Linnaeus's System
- Linnaeus was a Swedish naturalist who lived from 1707â€“1778
- He broadened Aristotle's System and formalized it into a **scientific system**
- His system also focused on an organism's **structure**
- His system was the **first formal system** of taxonomic organization
- Developed the modern day naming system, the **two-name system** (Genus & species)
- Also known as the **Father of Taxomony**
- Developed **Binomial Nomenclature**, which differed from Aristotle's system

#### Binomial Nomenclature
- Two-name system, Genus and species
- Uses Latin because it is an old, unchanging language
- Always italicized or underlined
- Genus is capitalized, but not species
- Names are made to a central organization to prevent duplicate names

## Classification Groups
> [!def]
> **Taxon  (taxa)**: a category into which related
- A hierarchy of taxa exists from broadest to most specific
> [!info] Hierarchy of taxonomic taxa
> - Domain
> 	- Kingdom
> 		- Phylum
> 			- Class
> 				- Order
> 					- Family
> 						- Genus
> 							- Species

Modern Taxonomic Groups help represent
- Homologous Structures
- Embryo development
- Molecular similarity in 
	- DNA
	- RNA
	- Amino Acids
	- Proteins

> [!def]
> **Cladograms**: Diagram showing how organisms are related based on shared, derived characteristics such as feathers, hair, or scales
> 
> **Dichotomous Keying**: All characteristics are dichotomous (have two options)
> Ex:
> - Dark
> 	- Big
> 		- Circular
> 		- Non-circular
> 	- Small
> 		- Circular
> 		- Non-circular
> - Light
> 	- Big
> 		- Circular
> 		- Non-circular
> 	- Small
> 		- Circular
> 		- Non-circular
> 
> Every division is dichotomous

#### Archaea
- No nucleus
- No Membrane bound organelles

##### Archaebacteria
- Probably the first alive things
- Lives in very harsh environments

#### Bacteria
- No nucleus
- No Membrane bound organelles

##### Eubacteria
- May cause disease
- Found in all non-harsh environments
- Important decomposers for the environment
- Commercially used to produce cheese, yoghur, etc.

#### Eukarya
- Yes nucleus
- Yes Membrane bound organelles

##### Protista
- Ex:
	- Protozoans
	- Algae
- Mostly Unicellular
- Could be autotrophic or heterotrophic
- Aquatic

##### Fungi
- Ex:
	- Mushroom
	- Yeasts
- Multicellular except yeast
- Absorptive heterotroph
- Cell walls made of chitin

##### Plantae
- Multicellular Plants
- Autotrophic
- Absorbs sunlight
- Cell walls made of cellulose

##### Plantae
- Multicellular Plants
- Autotrophic
- Absorbs sunlight
- Cell walls made of cellulose

##### Animalia
- Multicellular Animals
- Ingestive heterotrophs
- Feed on plants or animals
