# DNA Replication
## Semiconservative Replication
- Each strand serves as a guide to replicate onto the other side
- Steps
	- Unwinding
	- Base pairing
	- Joining

## Unwinding
- Starts with the double helix
- **DNA helicase** starts to **separate** the two sides of the double helix **starting at the origin**
- Single Stranded Binding Proteins (**SSB**) associate with the DNA to **prevent it from joining back together**
- **RNA Primase** adds a small RNA Primers to both strands of the DNA to **signal the DNA Polymerase to start**

## Base Pairing
- **DNA Polymerase** begins to **add new neucleotides** to each strand
	- Can only work in the **5' to 3'** direction (the added strand is 5' to 3')
	- Since **DNA is antiparallel**, one strand follows the helicase and one goes away
	- The strand going away is the **lagging strand**, the other is the **leading strand**
	- Since the lagging strand goes backwards, there will be many fragments of DNA, these are called **Okazaki Fragments**
	- The leading strand is continuous in replication while the lagging strand is discontinuous, which is why the replication is called **semidiscontinuous**
	- Each new strand contains one half strand of the old DNA, so it is called **semiconservative**
	- Also **checks the DNA** as it replicates it **for problems**

## Joining
- **DNA Ligase** comes and **joins the multiple Okazaki Fragments**
	- Also joins mutliple sections together from **other points of origin**

## Prokayotes vs Eukaryotes
| Eukaryotes                                     | Prokaryotes                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| One section is 10000 to 1mil base pairs        | Much shorter sections                  |
| Multiple areas of replication at the same time | Replicates from one place only         |
| Replication happens in both directions         | Replication happens in both directions |
