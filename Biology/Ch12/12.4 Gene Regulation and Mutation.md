# Gene Regulation and Mutation
## Mutations
> [!def]
> **Mutation**: A **permanent change** or mistake **in DNA** that happens **during replication**
### Types of mutations
![[Pasted image 20220125224103.png]]
#### Point Mutations

> [!def]
> **Point mutations**: A small mutation involving a singular nucleotide pair **substitution** (a pair being exchanged for something else)

1. **Missense** substitution - DNA is altered to code for the **wrong amino acid**
2. **Nonsense** substitution - DNA is **altered** to code **for a stop codon**
3. **Silent** substitution - DNA is altered, although **produces the same amino acid**

#### Frameshift Mutations
> [!def]
> **Framshift Mutation**: One base pair is inserted or deleted, making **all pairs afterwards read incorrectly**

1. **Insertion** - A base pair is added, making all base pairs afterwards shifted towards the end, this leads to the last base pair not making it into a codon
2. **Deletion** - A base pair is deleted, making all base pairs afterwards shift forwards, this leads to the last codon missing a pair
	
#### Duplication Mutations
> [!def]
> **Duplication Mutation**: A codon is repeated, leading to the protein to be longer

#### Expanding Mutations
> [!def]
> **Expending mutation**: A particular codon is repeated **several times**, repeating more and more over generations


#### Chromosomal mutations
> [!def]
> **Chromosomal mutation**: An entire portion of a chromosome being copied incorrectly
> 
> - Leads to large drastic effects on the expression of such genes

1. **Deletion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is completely deleted
		
2. **Duplication**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is duplicated next to itself
		
3. **Inversion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is flipped upside down, reversing the DNA
		
4. **Insertion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is moved to a completely different chromosome
		
5. **Translocation**
	
	- A section of two completely different chromosomes are swapped

### Protein folding and stability
**Both small and large mutations** can cause **proteins to misfold**, making them function incorrectly
> [!example]
> **Sickle blood cells**
> 
> - A single codon changes from **gutamic acid (GAA)** -> **valine (GUA)**
> - This leads to the protein being folded incorrectly

### Causes of mutation
#### Small mutations
Small mutations may just happen spontaneously, sometimes DNA polymerase adds the wrong nucleotide.

#### Larger (Chromosomal) mutations
> [!def]
> **Mutagen**: A substance which may cause mutations, might be a chemical or radiation

##### Chemicals
They may:
- **Bond in place of a nucleotide**, making further replication unsuccessful
- Alter the chemical structure of DNA leading it to **mispair**

##### Radiation
1. High energy rays may cause **electrons to be misplaced**
2. The misplaced electron (free radical) is free from any atom
3. This **free radical can react violently** with other molecules including DNA
