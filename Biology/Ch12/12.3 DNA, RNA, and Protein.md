# DNA, RNA, and Protein
## Central Dogma
- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
### RNA
| RNA                                                  | DNA             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Uracil                                               | Thymine         |
| Single stranded                                      | Double stranded |
| Found in the Nucleus and in the cytoplasm as well | Only found inside the Nucleus                |

There are most commonly three types of RNA:
1. Messenger RNA (**mRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122150954.png]]
	- Form complementary to a single strand of DNA
	- Travel from **Nucleus to Ribosome** to instruct it to create proteins
2. Ribosomal RNA (**rRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122151014.png]]
	- Associates with proteins to **form ribosomes**
3. Transfer RNA (**tRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122151024.png]]
	- Smaller RNA
	- **Transports amino acids** to the ribosome

### Transcription
In Transcription, **DNA is transcribed into mRNA**
- Happens **in the nucleus**
- After DNA is unzipped, **RNA Polymerase** binds to a strand to DNA and creates the **mRNA in the 3' -> 5' direction (on the DNA)**
- The strand of DNA that's used to make the RNA is called the **template strand**
	- The other is called the **nontemplate strand**
- After creation is done, it will **leave the nuclear membrane** into the cytoplasm

### RNA processing
- After the mRNA is made from the DNA, some of the sequence is not needed
	- Unneeded sections are called the **introns**
	- Needed sections are called **extrons**
- Before leaving the nucleus
	- Introns are removed by spliceozymes (a ribosome)
	- **Protective cap** added on the 5' side
	- **Long sequence of A's** added to the end (3' side)
- Sometimes unprocessed RNA is called **pre-mRNA** (in eukaryotic cells)

## The Code

- Hypothesised that protein synthesis instructions are stored in the DNA
- There are **20 types of amino acids**, so there must be more than 20 combinations of DNA
- Later it was found that **three-base codes** were what encoded DNA (giving 64 combinations)
- Group of three pairs is called a **codon**

### Translation
1. mRNA's **5' end** connects to the ribosome
2. tRNA folds into a **clover** leaf shape
3. tRNA is activated by an enzyme that attaches an **amino acid** to the 3' end (corresponding to its anticodon)
4. In the middle of the tRNA there is an **anticodon** (codon complementary to a codon on the mRNA)

### The role of the ribosome
- The ribosome is made of two parts and are not connected when protein translation is not happening
- Contains three grooves: A, P, E
1. Once the mRNA associates with the ribosome, a tRNA with anticodon CAU will bind to the AUG (start) codon in the mRNA (5' end)
2. Then another tRNA will **attach in the A groove** with an anticodon to the next codon on the tRNA, **carrying its corresponding amino acid**
3. the rRNA in the ribosome **catalyses the two tRNAs to join the amino acids** together with **peptide bonds** into a string, moving the amino acid string from the tRNA in position P to the one in position A
4. tRNA continues to **enter the A site**, pushing the one in the A site into the P site and the one in the P site into the E site and finally, the last tRNA will **leave the E site**
5. the string of mRNA is **read until a stop codon appears** and the string of amino acids is complete
6. Then the string gets folded in the golgi body

### tRNA
- They are reusable
- Have a specific anticodon
- They can only bind to a particular amino acid corresponding to the anticodon
- They use the ribosome to help produce amino acid strings
