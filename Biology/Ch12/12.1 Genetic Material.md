# Genetic Material
## Discovery of Genetic Material
### Mendel's work was rediscovered
- In the 1900s, people **already knew** that genetic info was **stored in the chromosomes**
- They **did not know** whether the info was **stored in the protein or the DNA** (nucleic acid), since chromosomes were made of both

### Griffith
- Griffith's experiment was on **two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae**
- The two strains were (**S**)mooth and (**R**)ough
- S had a sugar coat on it, and caused pnemonia
- Griffith's observations
- 
| Smooth Strain | Rough Strain   | Dead Smooth Strain | Dead Smooth Strain + Rough Strain |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Mouse died    | Mouse Survived | Mouse Survived     | Mouse Died                        |
- He concluded that live **R strains can be transformed into S strains**

### Avery
- Avery tested what part of the S strain turns the R strain into an S strain
- He tested:
	- DNA
	- Protein
	- Lipids
- He found that only the **DNA made the R strand turn into an S strand**
- He theorized that the **DNA from the S strand leaked** and the **R strand picked it up and replicated it**, creating live S strands

### Hershey and Chase

Bacteriophage
- A type of virus
- Attacks bacteria
- In this study, the type selected was made of only **DNA and protein**
- Cannot reproduce on their own, need to inject themselves into a living cell

Method
- There are two groups of bacteriophage and liquid culture medium
- Radioactive labeling
	- In the **first** group
		- Bacteriophage grown in **radioactive Phosphorous**
		- DNA contains Phosphorous while Protein does not
		- **Labels the DNA** radioactively
	- In the **second** group
		- Bacteriophage grown in **radioactive Sulfur**
		- Protein contains Sulfur while DNA does not
		- **Labels the Protein** radioactively
- Labeled bacteriophage was then put in the liquid culture to hijack and reproduce
- After some time, the bacteriophage was removed, when the DNA was already injected into the culture (probably using a blender)
- The bacteriophage was then separated using a centrifuge and readings of the radioactivity taken
	- Culture sinks to the bottom while the bacteriophage floats to the top
- Radioactivity Results
	- In the **first** group
		- Radioactivity was detected in the **bottom** of the vial (where the **culture** was)
		- Since the first group labeled the DNA, this proves that the DNA moves on into the culture
		- **DNA is used in the reproduction** of the bacteriophage
	- In the **second** group
		- Radioactivity was detected in the **top** of the vial (where the removed **bacteriophage** was)
		- Since the second group labeled the Protein, this proves that the Proteins stay with the bacteriophage
		- **Protein is not used in reproduction**
- Conclusion is that DNA is used in reproduction of bacteriophage, not Protein

## DNA Structure
- After Hershey-Chase, scientists believed that DNA was the genetic material
- We still do not know how RNA and DNA was formed

### Nucleotides
- Nucleotides are what **make up Nucleic Acids** (including DNA and RNA)
- Parts of a nucleotide (discovered by **P. A. Levene**)
	- 5C Sugar
	- Phosphate Group
	- Nitogenous Base
- **Purine Bases have two rings** while **Pyrimidine Bases have one**
- **DNA**'s Nitrogenous Base will always be one of
	- Adenine (Purine Base)
	- Guanine (Purine Base)
	- Cytosine (Pyramidine Base)
	- Thymine (Pyramidine Base)
- **RNA**'s Nitrogenous Base will always be one of
	- Adenine (Purine Base)
	- Guanine (Purine Base)
	- Cytosine (Pyramidine Base)
	- Uracil (Pyramidine Base)

### Chargaff
- Found that the amount of A and T, and G and C in a cell are roughly the same
- Chargaff's Rule: $C=G \text{ \& } T=A$

### Franklin
- Took photo 51, which depicted a double helix

### Watson and Crick
- Used their own as well as Chargaff's and Franklin's data to make new conclusions
- Conclusions
	- The two outside strands consist of alternating deoxyribose and phosphate
	- **C and T** pair together with **three hydrogen bonds**
	- **T and A** pair together with **two hydrogen bonds**

### DNA Structure
- **C and T** pair together with **three hydrogen bonds**
- **T and A** pair together with **two hydrogen bonds**
- Purine Bases can only bond with Pyramidine bases because of the space between the rails of the double helix
- The total number of pyramidine bases will **always equal** to the number of purine bases

### Orientation
- Each side of the double helix points the opposite direction as they are **antiparallel**
