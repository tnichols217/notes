## 10.2 Mendelian Genetics
1. Explain the significance of Mendel's experiments to the study of genetics.
2. Summarize the law of segregation and law of independent assortment.  
3. Predict the possible offspring from a cross using a Punnett square/genetic diagrams. 

Answers:

- Gregor Mendel found a few interesting things while he was breeding his pea plants as a hobby
- He found that specific combinations of pea parents had non-random children (predictable color)
- He conducted an experiment by crossing Homozygous green peas (CC) with homozygous yellow peas (cc)
	- Found that the first generation were all green, he did not know yet but these were all heterozygous green peas
	- The second generation had 75% green and 25% yellow
		- This is because the yellow peas were masked in the first generation, being recessive
		- Later in the second generation there was a 25% chance of getting a homozgous yellow pea again
- The two most notable conclusions are his two Laws of inheritance
	1. **Law of Segregation**
		- Each offspring will **only recieve one** of each gene from each parent
		- This leads to a "blend" of the parents in the child, this leads to genetic variation in the offspring due to recieveing different genes from each parent
	2. **Law of Independent Assortment**
		- All genes are inherited independently of each other
		- Means that eye color does **not** effect your skin color for example
			- Ex:
				- Q: If your parents both have heterozygous alleles for cleft chin (Pp) and heterozygous for hair texture (curly dominant) (Cc) and you know the child has a cleft chin, what is the probablility of having straight hair?
				- A: Because of Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, knowing anything about his cleft chin does not tell us anything about his hair texture, so this information can be ignored.

					|hair texture|C|c|
					|-|-|-|
					|C|CC|Cc|
					|c|Cc|cc|
				- The probability of having curly hair is **25%**
				- EXTRA: To verify the law of Independent Assortment, we can conduct a dihybrid cross

					|hair texture and cleft chin|PC|Pc|pC|pc|
					|-|-|-|-|-|
					|PC|PPCC|PPCc|PpCC|PpCc|
					|Pc|PPCc|PPcc|PpCc|Ppcc|
					|pC|PpCC|PpCc|ppCC|ppCc|
					|pc|PpCc|Ppcc|ppCc|ppcc|

					Phenotypes:

					|hair texture and cleft chin|PC|Pc|pC|pc|
					|-|-|-|-|-|
					|PC|PC|PC|PC|PC|
					|Pc|PC|Pc|PC|Pc|
					|pC|PC|PC|pC|pC|
					|pc|PC|Pc|pC|pc|

				- Restating: given cleft chin (phenotype **p**)
				- There are 4 possibilities with cleft chin 
					- **pC**, **pC**, **pC**, **pc**
				- Out of these four possibilities, only one has straight hair (**pc**)
				- We get a result of **25%**, the same as when we use the Law of Independent Assortment 

		- If this law is not true, it means if you had black hair for example, you would know that you would more about which eye color you would have


## Chapter 10.3 Gene Linkage and Polyploidy

1. Summarize how the process of meiosis produces genetic recombination.  
2. Explain how gene linkage can be used to create chromosome maps.  
3. Analyze why polyploidy is important to the field of agriculture.

Answers:

1. **Recombination**
	- In Prophase 1 in Meiosis, Synapsis (crossing over) occurs, where the chromosomes which are close to each other swap some DNA
			- Term comes from the chromosomes crossing and switching the ends of the chromatids

	- In Metaphase 1 in Meiosis the arrangement of which chromosome goes to each daughter cell is random

	- In Metaphase 2 in Meiosis, the rotation of the chromosome is random, so which chromatid goes to which cell is also random


2. **Linkage and maps**
	- Gene linkage is when genes that are close to each other physically on the chromosome are less likely to be separated due to their physical proximity
	- The probability of closer genes being separated is lower
	- Ex: 

		|Gene pair|Probability of being recombined|
		|-|-|
		|AB|3%|
		|AC|5%|
		|BC|8%|

	- Since AB have the lowest probability, we will start with that
		- Since it is the smallest, they are the closest on the chromosome
		- A---B
	- The next smallest is AC, but now we do not know if C is on the same side as B or not
		- There are two possibilities:
			- (1) C-----A---B
			- (2) A---B--C
	- Lastly there is BC, this has to be the largest distance since it has the highest chance
		- In the first (2) possibility, B and C are close together, so this cannot be our answer
		- We conclude that the gene map is
			- **C-----A---B**
3. **Polyploidy and Agriculture**
	- Polyploidy is when a cell has more than two of each chromosome
	- Haploids have one of each, diploids have two, and polyploids have more
	- Since polyploids have more than two of each chromosome, the cell needs to be bigger to have more space for the increased genetic material
		- This leads to larger fruits (farmers love it)

## Chapter 11.2 Complex Inheritance
1. Distinguish between codominance and incomplete dominance.
2. Predict and analyze the patterns and outcomes (genotype/phenotype) for crosses involving:
	1. Codominance
	2. Incomplete dominance
	3. Multiple alleles
	4. Polygenetic traits
	5. Sex-linked traits
3. Summarize the effect of environment on phenotypic changes.

Answers:

1. **Codominance and Incomplete dominance**
	- Ex: red + white flower
	- In Codominance both alleles are shown, like a red and white flower
	- In Incomplete Dominance, a mixture or something different will show, like a pink flower

2. **Patterns and outcomes (Punnett Squares)**
	1. **Codominance**
		- Alleles R (red) and W (white) are codominant, where RW is pink
		- Cross RW and RW

			|Color|R|W|
			|-|-|-|
			|R|RR|RW|
			|W|RW|WW|
			
			Phenotype

			|Color|R|W|
			|-|-|-|
			|R|Red|Pink|
			|W|Pink|White|

		- 25% chance of Red, 50% of Pink, 25% of White

	2. **Incomplete dominance**
		- Alleles R (red) and W (white) are Incompletely dominant
		- Cross RW and RW

			|Color|R|W|
			|-|-|-|
			|R|RR|RW|
			|W|RW|WW|
			
			Phenotype

			|Color|R|W|
			|-|-|-|
			|R|Red|Red and white|
			|W|Red and white|White|

		- 25% chance of Red, 50% of red and white, 25% of White

	3. **Multiple alleles**
		- Bunnies have four possible alleles for fur color, listed in most dominant to least dominant:
			- $C$ - Brown
			- $c^{ch}$ - Chinchilla
			- $c^h$ - Himalayan
			- $c$ - Albino
		- Cross $Cc^h$ and $c^{ch}c$

			|Color|$C$|$c^h$|
			|-|-|-|
			|$c^{ch}$|$Cc^{ch}$|$c^{ch}c^h$|
			|$c$|$Cc$|$c^hc$|
			
			Phenotype

			|Color|R|W|
			|-|-|-|
			|R|Brown|Chinchilla|
			|W|Brown|Himalayan|

		- 50% chance of Brown, 25% of Chinchilla, 25% of Himalayan

	4. **Polygenetic traits**
		- There are 5 eye colors:

			|Eye color|Genotype|
			|-|-|
			|Black eyes|BBGG|
			|Dark Brown eyes|BBGg, BbGG|
			|Light Brown eyes|BbGg, BBgg, bbGG|
			|Green eyes|Bbgg, bbGg|
			|Blue eyes|bbgg|
		- If one parent has Light brown eyes of genotype **BbGg** and the other has Blue eyes, what is the probability that the child will have green eyes

			|Two eye color genes|BG|Bg|bG|bg|
			|-|-|-|-|-|
			|bg|BbGg|Bbgg|bbGg|bbgg|
			|bg|BbGg|Bbgg|bbGg|bbgg|
			|bg|BbGg|Bbgg|bbGg|bbgg|
			|bg|BbGg|Bbgg|bbGg|bbgg|

			Phenotypes:

			|Two eye color genes|BG|Bg|bG|bg|
			|-|-|-|-|-|
			|bg|Light Brown|Green|Green|Blue|
			|bg|Light Brown|Green|Green|Blue|
			|bg|Light Brown|Green|Green|Blue|
			|bg|Light Brown|Green|Green|Blue|
			
		- 50% change of getting green eyes

	5. **Sex-linked traits**
		- $X_g$ and $X_G$ are the alleles of a sex-linked gene on the X-chromosome
		- $X_G$ is dominant, and $X_g$ (baldness) is recessive
		- Cross $X_GX_g$ with $X_GY$

			|Baldness|$X_G$|$X_g$|
			|-|-|-|
			|$X_G$|$X_GX_G$|$X_GX_g$|
			|$Y$|$X_GY$|$X_gY$|
			
			Phenotype

			|Baldness|$X_G$|$X_g$|
			|-|-|-|
			|$X_G$|Hairy Female|Hairy Female|
			|$Y$|Hairy Male|Bald Male|

		- 50% chance of Hairy Female, 25% of Hairy Male, 25% of Bald Male
3. Environment and phenotypic changes
	- Your phenotype can be effected by the enironment
		- Temperature and sunlight effects skin color
		- Sunlight and water effect the color plants
