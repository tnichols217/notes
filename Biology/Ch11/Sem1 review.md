				- Observation:

## U6-C10 Sexual Reproduction and Genetics
1. Meiosis
	1. Explain the reduction in chromosome number that occurs during meiosis. 
		- After DNA synthesis, each chromosome will have two sister chromatids
		- Then, after meiosis 1, instead of the sister chromatids separating, the paired chromosomes will separate
		- After anaphase, each cell will have half the amount of chromosomes, making them haploids
	2. Recognize and summarize the stages of meiosis.  
		- Round 1
			- Important because it creates new DNA recombinant from the mom and dad's DNA.
			1. Prophase 1
				1. Nucleus is still there
				2. Chromosomes are condensing from the DNA
				3. DNA gets **shorter** and **thicker**
				4. The Homologous pairs of chromosomes get close to each other and switch portions of DNA
					1.  This is called **Synapsis**
					2.  This process does not need to be symmetrical across both daughter chromatids
					3.  Synapsis is why we have 4 distinct and different gametes in the end
			2. Prometaphase 1 (sometimes considered part of the metaphase)
				1. Nucleus membrance disappears
				2. Formation of microtubules
					1. Attach to the chromosomes (centrometer of it)
			3. Metaphase 1 (Middle)
				1. Chromosomes line up to the middle of the cell
				2. They line up next to each other in homologous pairs down the middle of the cell
				3. They will not all line up in the same order, so the random assortment creates a new combination of genes
			4. Anaphase 1 (Away)
				1. The homologous chromosomes get separated
				2. The sister chromatids do not get separated like normal mitosis
				3. The chromosomes move away from the center to the edges of the cell
				4. The spindles (microtubules) help pull them to the edges
			5. Telophase 1 (Two)
				1. Chromosomes reach the poles
				2. Two new neuclei are formed
				3. Microtubules disappears

		- Round 2
			- Round 2 happens **similar to normal mitosis**, except for the cells are already Haploids
			- This results in 4 haploid cells from the original single precursor before meiosis
	3. Analyze the importance of meiosis in providing genetic variation. 
		- Law of segregation
			- Each parent only contributes one allele of each gene to the offspring
		- Law of independent assortment
			- Each gene is inherited independently of each other
			- This means that hair color does not effect eye color
			- Everything is random
				- Synapsis
				- Orientation of the lining up in metaphase 1
				- Orientation in metaphase 2
			- Exception is linked genes (on the same chromosome)
		- Synapsis (crossing over)
