# Complex Inheritance
## Incomplete Dominance
- Normally, only the dominant allele will show for normal dominance
- In incomplete dominance, the phenotype will be a mix of both the recessive and dominant alleles
	- Ex: red (dominant) flowers + white (recessive) => pink (heterozygous) flowers

## Codominance
- In codominance, both the alleles are shown, unmixed
	- Ex: red flowers + white flowers => red middle with white ringed flowers

## Multiple Alleles
- It is possible for a particular allele to have more than two types
- Instead of just having $L$ and $l$, you could have $l_a$ and $a_b$ on top of the other two allele types.
- Normally there will be an order of dominance for these alleles, like $L$ being the most dominant, next being $l_a$ then $l_b$ then $l$
- Blood types are an example

## Sex-linked traits
- Some genes may be carried on the sex chromosome instead of an autosome, this leads to that gene being sex-related
- Females are XX while males are XY
- If there is an X-linked gene, then for the male, there will be no competing allele, so whatever is on the X gene will become the phenotype.
- Females _will_ have two competing alleles, which makes them more resistant to recessive disorders

## Polygenic traits
- Certain traits may be a combination of more than one gene and/or allele
- Ex
	- Height
	- Skin color
	- Eye color
	- Fingerprint

## Effect of environment
- You adapt to the environment around you
- Without sunlight, a plant will become white
- Temperature can effect certain traits
- Is one reason why identical twins will begin to look different after a while
