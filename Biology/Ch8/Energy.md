# Energy
## The two laws of thermodynamics
### 1) Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- The universe has a certain amount of energy and it doesn't increase or decrese, it is always constant.
- When energy is "used" it is just being converted into other forms
- Examples
	- Light (Electrical -> Light)


### 2) Energy can be converted, however into less useful forms
