# Photosynthesis
> $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$
> Carbon Dioxide + Water -> Glucose + Oxygen

- Happens in the **Chloroplasts**
	- Inside the **Grana** (stacks of Thylakoids)
		- Inside the **Thylakoid** is **cholophyll** (pigment)
	- Inside the **Stroma** (outside the grana)
- Produces **NADPH** and **ATP**
- **Chlorophyll** absorbs mainly red and blue light

## Light Dependent Reaction (Electron Transport)
- Inside the **Thylakoid**
- High gradient of Hydrogen is inside the **Thylakoid Space**
	- The low pressure is the **Stroma**
- It produces **NADPH and ATP**
1. Light excites electrons inside Photosystem II
	1. Causes a water molecule to split
	2. Sends a proton (Hydrogen ion) into the thylakoid space from the stroma
	3. Oxygen is released (from water)
2. Electrons through the electron accepter molecule down the electron carriers to Photosystem I
3. Electrons are transferred to ferrodoxin in Photosystem I
4. Ferrodoxin transfers electrons to NADP+ and releases it into the Stroma
	1. Turns the NADP+ into NADPH
5. Protons move down the gradient through the ATP synthase to the Stroma
	1. Turns ADP into ATP

## Light Independent Reaction (Calvin Cycle)
- Converts the NADPH and ATP into glucose for long term storage
- Uses **18 ATP and 12 NADPH** to make one glucose
- Happens inside the **Stroma**, outside the Thylakoid

### Steps in the Calvin Cycle
#### 1) Carbon Fixation
1) 
> $CO_2 + C_5H_{12}O_{11}P_2 \rightarrow C_6H_{14}O_{11}P_2$
> Carbon Dioxide + RuBP (5C) -> 6-Carbon intermediary
>
>**Simplified:**
>> $CO_2 + 5C \rightarrow 6C$
>> Carbon Dioxide + RuBP (5C) -> 6C
2) 
> $C_6H_{14}O_{11}P_2 + H_2O \rightarrow 2C_3H_7O_7P$
> 6-Carbon intermediary + Water -> 2 3-PGA (3C)
>
>**Simplified:**
>> $6C + H_2O \rightarrow 2(3C)$
>> 6C +  Water -> 2 3-PGA (3C)

Overall
> $CO_2 + C_5H_{12}O_{11}P_2 + H_2O \rightarrow 2C_3H_7O_7P$
> Carbon Dioxide + RuBP (5C) + Water -> 2 3-PGA (3C)
>
>**Simplified:**
>> $CO_2 + 3(5C) + H_2O \rightarrow 2(3C)$
>> Carbon Dioxide + RuBP (5C) + Water -> 2 3-PGA (3C)

#### 2) Reduction
> $C_3H_7O_7P + ATP + NADPH \rightarrow C_3H_5O_6P + ADP + NADP$
> 3-PGA (3C) + ATP + NADPH -> G3P + ADP + NAPH
>
>**Simplified:**
>> $3C + ATP + NADPH \rightarrow 3C$
>> 3-PGA (3C) + ATP + NADPH -> G3P (3C)

#### 3) Regeneration
- One G3P leaves the cycle to produce Glucose
- The other 5 stay to regenerate the RuBP

> $5C_3H_5O_6P + 3ATP \rightarrow 3C_5H_{12}O_{11}P_2 + 3ADP$
> 5 G3P + 3 ATP -> 3 RuBP + ADP

#### 4) Glucose Formation
> $2C_3H_5O_6P \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6$
> 2 G3P -> Glucose

I couldn't find anything about this so idk what to put
