# Specifications

Learning systems are given a:
1. Learning task
2. Task examples $E$
3. Performance measure $P$

It's purpose is to produce a **concept** that is good by evaluations with $P$ on all examples $E$

## Feature Information

Features may be in one of the following categories:

1. Discrete Categorical data
2. Continuous Numerical
3. Discrete Numerical
4. Hierarchal features
	1. Features may be specifics or groups
	2. ie. Dog, Animal, Fish, Salmon, Mammal

Features are very useful when in matrix form as it is more easily processed and parallelized. All features may be thought of as points in higher dimensional space.
