# Week \#

## 1

Briefly summarize your knowledge of the area you are studying as of last week, and your plans for the current week from Q7 of your last diary. If this is the first diary write "Not Applicable."

## 2

List all resources you have read or looked at this week, along with the time you spent on each one (to the nearest 1/2 hour is enough). For web pages, blog posts, videos etc, provide links and titles. For papers, provide links and citations. For AI tools, provide a transcript of your session in a separate file in the Week_n folder, and list the file name (as a link) here.

## 3

Summarize what you have learned **this week** from the resources above. Be clear, detailed and precise. It is ok to be uncertain about the content. Do **not** copy/paste content from any resource.

Answer: "From paper X, I learned about...I read blog post Y to clarify... but video Z said that...This made me even more confused. AI tool G said...My current understanding is..."

## 4

Describe any new ideas you may have had as you were studying the resources, and if you did any follow ups to investigate these ideas.

## 5

If you implemented/ran any code or algorithms from the resources or while investigating any new ideas, describe what you did. Link to a jupyter notebook in your Week_n folder showing the runs. You may also include python files containing code in your Week_n folder. If so, their content should be described here. If you forked another repo or imported pre-built code, please provide a link. If an AI tool wrote part of the code, please provide a session transcript in the Week_n folder and link to it here. If any part of the code did not run or did not behave as expected, describe your best guess why and possible fixes.

## 6

Summarize any specific points of confusion, uncertainty or difficulty from your reading or implementation that arose from your readings or implementations this week. This can partly overlap with your answer (3).

## 7

List specific goals you would like to accomplish for next week and action items aligned with these goals based on your answers above. Be as specific as you can.
