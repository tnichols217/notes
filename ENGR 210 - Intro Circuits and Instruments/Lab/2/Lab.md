## Discussion Questions

Working with your lab partner, clearly and legibly answer each of the following questions based on the lab experience. Be sure to answer each part of each question, and link your answers to your data where possible.

### 1

Using Ohm’s Law, the principle of the voltage divider, and your data from Part 1, calculate the internal resistance of the AA battery. Neatly show all your work, and clearly indicate your final value (take the average of the values calculated for both the $10\ohm$ and $100\ohm$ resistors). Referencing a reliable source (e.g. research paper, technical specifications), does this value make sense for a AA alkaline battery? Why or why not? (4 points)  

### 2

Consider the following scenario: you are given two “black boxes” that are insulated from view. One box contains a AA battery (i.e. a voltage source in series with a resistor). The other contains a current source in parallel with a resistor (think back to Lab 1). You cannot observe the circuit within the box, nor can you measure heat or any other physical quantity for the circuit except for the voltage and current behavior at the terminals of the device. Is there any way to tell the difference between the circuits? If so, how? If not, why not? (4 points)

### 3

Using Excel or another graphing software, create one well-formatted plot of current ($y$-axis) vs. voltage ($x$-axis) for both the red and blue LEDs from Part 2 (use the voltage drop measured across the LED). Fit each curve with an exponential curve trend line and indicate the formula describing the fit for each curve. Include this plot below. Be sure to clearly differentiate between the two curves. (5 points)

### 4

Compare the $I-V$ relationships of the red and blue LEDs from Part 2 to the $I-V$ behavior expected from the $100\ohm$ resistor from the voltage divider circuit that you built in Lab 1. Which component could we characterize using Ohm’s Law, and why? (4 points)

### 5

Most LEDs (as well as many other electrical components) are limited in the amount of power that they are able to dissipate. Given that the amount of power dissipated is directly related to both current and voltage (and considering your LED data), why is it necessary to include a current-limiting resistor with the LED? (4 points)

### 6

How did the soldering portion of the lab go? Describe any difficulties encountered, as well as how you overcame those difficulties. (4 points)
