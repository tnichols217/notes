## Response

My final project remains on the differences of school of thought in humans and AI, and how we can further research into the thought processes of humans such that we may benefit AI by attempting to encode this reasoning model for general GPTs. I have not yet found a dataset for this, but as mentioned prior, there would very unlikely be any hard and fast data relating to this. Majority of the understanding and research surrounding my idea would be purely soft and analytic, instead of hard and numerical. This does increase the difficulty of my project, but it still does interest me.
