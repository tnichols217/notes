I find the current implementation of artificial intelligence — particularly neural networks — fails to capture the uniqueness and originality of human thought. As a Computer Scientist, I have been studying in the field of AI for an extended period of time now, including participating in research and working in the field.

The current state of neural networks and other various forms of AI struggle in multiple areas including: memorization of the input data, leading to a lack of creativity; hallucinations, making up content that is blatantly false; and a general failiure to synthesize or create new things. These three issues are at odds with each other — failing to be creative, yet being too creative to be truthful when used analytically.

I hope to learn about the human method of thought, in order to better understand what makes our own ability to think multitudes better than the current state of artificial intelligence in the field. In particular, I am curious as to what possibly leads our thought to be original, yet remaining within the scope of the area without completely randomly diverging from the original task.

With a better understanding of human cognition, I will understand where neural networks fall short in its quest to simulate the way our brain works, and how we can modify them in a way to more closely simulate genuine thought.
