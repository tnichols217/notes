### Pure Representations of Mental Processes

The model of Lambda Calculus defines a pure representation of the ideas of functional programming in computers. Its main principles include purity, immutability, and composition by defining any kind of mutation or change in data as a function. Lambda calculus and by extension functional programming are an atomic and pure way of understanding the ideas of computing and computers in general. These ideas can be directly compared to mental processes in order to further push our understanding of cognitive methods.

Lambda calculus reduces all concepts of computing to two simple objects: functions and variables. Variables are static objects that cannot change; they represent values or groups of values whether it be a list of other objects or just a number. Functions — in their purest form — represent the mutation or combination of objects. This can be as simple as addition being the sum of two numbers, where the numbers are variables and the action of addition is the function. Lambda calculus also requires that functions have no external influence, relying only on the inputs to the function without any kind of side effects. Lastly, prior information may be incorporated into a function through the idea of higher-order functions. Since functions take objects as arguments, they may take other functions as arguments, leading to a higher-order function returning a function that contains prior information from the function generator. This combination of ideas allow lambda calculus to represent any kind of computation in a clean, atomic, and reproducible manner.

In comparison to lambda calculus, mental processes draw direct parallels with the ideas and emergent behavior of lambda calculus. For example, perception itself draws a direct parallel to a pure function: taking in sensory input and converting it into a mental representation for further processing later. Memory draws a direct parallel to the storage of variables, where the structure of memory is directly similar to the type of the variable. Long term memory or intrinsic ideals on the other hand are directly similar to variable constants — remaining consistent over time. Decision-making involves applying a sequence of processes to observed information, closely mimicking a meta-function pipeline from the ideas of functional programming. This would involve prior information such as core beliefs, long term memory, current desires, current constraints, and of course the relevant observed information. By applying the ideas of functional programming to cognitive processes, we can more strongly visualize and represent what information is needed and thought upon when making decisions.

However, you may think that instead human thought processes are not completely reproducible and consistent, but thought the concepts of function pipelining, this background information may be consistently applied to the thought process of humans. This concept may be expanded atomically to encompass all knowable information, with reducing benefits, and thus a simpler model without all information would still be relevant and important. This idea of re-explaining side-effects or moving them to a prior in order to keep calculations and inferrences pure and clean is an idea pulled directly from lambda calculus that has strong utility in the understanding of cognition.

As explained prior, there is a reducing benefit given more and more information about the human and the environment the human is in. This directly leads to the question of how useful is this model for understanding cognitive processes? Also as explained prior, the idea of moving unexplainable information or side-effects of the system to priors of thought offer a unique ability to understand higher level thought. It allows us to think about and understand what information is still important, albeit unmeasurable or ungiven, leading to a deeper understanding of the end of the thought process when all other information has already been given. This would include other transient properties such as emotion, feelings, and current circumstance that may not normally be thought about in an atomic thought process model.

Lambda calculus draws strong and direct parallels to the thought processes of humans, directly applying the ideas of purity in processing to the throught process by preconditioning on side-effects and other unexplained information. This model would allow researchers to better formulate and understand thought processes by giving them a baseline model of pure thought before understanding any additional, extra information that may help the processes further. This thought model may also be amplified and pushed further with the ideas of graphical reasoning — as if reasoning is directional, it may be directly represented and understood as a lambda calculus.
