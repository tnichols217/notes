# Red Hen Lab Access

## Prompt

- Post on your Blog a statement that you have established two-factor authentication at UCLA, and, if possible, give a screenshot attesting to this establishment.
- Post as text, not as an attached file, on your Blog a short report of . . . your thoughts about using such a computational tool to establish a dataset that would let you explore some question about cognition. It might be easiest if you think of a research question that has to do with language, gesture, and multimodal communication.

The above screenshot shows that my UCLA account has 2FA

I feel like a computational tool like this would be very useful to find relevant information about computation, however due to its low information density, I do not feel like it is an all-encompasing source. If you are researching something in particular, I feel like I would have a hard time finding enough information and perspectives to create a well informed opinion on topics. It is useful to be able to search sources that typically would not be indexed however, like video-news and other non-text media, however in the modern age, almost all relevant content that is non-text has text tags or markers to make it discoverable, further diminishing the importance of a search tool like this.
