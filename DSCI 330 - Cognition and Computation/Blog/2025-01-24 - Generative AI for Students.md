# Generative AI for Students

## Prompt

Post 100 words of feedback on your blog. How could this short course be improved?

## Response

I feel like the course does touch on several relevant topics on the usage of AI in general for students. However, I feel like the course is heavily skewed towards education on GPT-style AI models, and does not cover the usage or applications of other kinds of AI. It also does not seem to include methods of self-decision on the balance of AI and individual thought, instead pushing on the student opinions and beliefs that may seem baseless without a method for the student to come to on their own terms. Overall I think this is a good start on educating students on the uses and pitfalls of modern GPT models.
