# Material Anchors

## Prompt

Post 150 words on your student page commenting on something interesting you have seen in your life that involves material anchors for computation to aid human cognition.

## Response

Material anchors are things that utilize something physical, primarily on the human body, to aid cognition in a related area. Counting on your fingers is an example of a material anchor. Counting into large numbers can sometimes be hard for humans to hold completely in your head, so utilizing fingers as a mode of persistent storage is commonly done to keep track of one of the higher positional digits when counting. Extending this behavior, computer scientists occasionally utilize the 2-state nature of fingers to help count and do binary math, where actuation of each finger stores a 1 or 0 state for each positional in a binary number. Being able to offload storage of information is something humans do very frequently in order to free up mental capacity to do more thinking about relevant topics. This is prevalently demonstrated by the numerous ways people take notes or even set reminders for themselves such that we may focus our capacity to other things.
