# Material Anchors

## Prompt

Post 150 words on your student page commenting on something interesting you have seen in your life that involves material anchors for computation to aid human cognition.

## Response

The clock is an example of a material anchor for the representation of time. It both represents and encapsulates the cyclical nature of time and still displays an accurate and useful representation of it. More commonly for analog clocks, it also shows the time as segments of each 12-hour half of the day, offering both an emphasis of the idea of noon and midnight as well as more resolution in being able to tell the hour. The nature of the three hands is also semi-self explanatory in nature. All three hands, constantly moving are an example of time, with the fastest moving one clearly alluding to seconds, then minutes, then hours, further increasing the intuition of reading a clockface. The clock, often with little to no markings on it is a great example of how a physical anchor can so strongly relate to such an abstract topic such as time.
