# Homework on prompting

## Prompt

Review some YouTube videos on how to prompt Deep Research.  See [Introduction to Deep Research](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/YkCDVn3_wiw?si%3DQksFfSOCK12XiWdz&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1739830180828003&usg=AOvVaw2nOr06ixMgM9oxCYzSJVSz) and [Deep Research FAQ | OpenAI Help Center](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1739830180828003&usg=AOvVaw3LXc18YOb7_vhGaSfrrfj_). Now, write a prompt that could be submitted to Deep Research to generate a first report for your research topic in this class.  Think it through.  Give extra background of the sort that you could use to answer the kinds of questions Deep Research would ask you as it tries to write its report.

## Response (Opt Out)

Acting as an expert in Bioinformatics research, investigate and analyze the RNA-seq transcript identification pipeline outlined below, focusing the three core areas of recognizing the key steps of the pipeline, researching modern equivalents or alternatives, and offering advice on where the pipeline may be improved or changed to improve the overall process of the analysis pipeline.

The current pipeline process utilizes the following pieces of software: FastQC, Trimmomatic, STAR alignment, Stringtie, ribopicker, CPC2 incRNA, FeelNC, Salmon quant, and DESeq2. Specifically identify key points in this pipeline that have a high importance over the overall performance of the pipeline as a whole.

After identifying key points, research specific alternatives and equivalents to the pieces in the pipeline to recognize if there are better ways of analyzing the data. In specific, check if there are ways to improve the accuracy, speed, effeciency, or more modern equivalents to the different steps in the pipeline.

Lastly, restructure the pipeline in a way that would novelly improve the analysis method, making transcript identification and comparison much easier for researchers.
