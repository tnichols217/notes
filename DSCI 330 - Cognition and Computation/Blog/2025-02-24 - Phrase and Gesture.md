# Phrase and Gesture

## Prompt

Study [https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-public-site/elan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-public-site/elan&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1742010531790021&usg=AOvVaw1RcGiUU6Ej1qzMEukG3ybW). Its section on "interesting co-speech gestures" is your model for this assignment. Come up with your own interesting phrase and accompanying co-speech gestures.  Find five examples in Red Hen (via the Edge Search engine), and post on your blog a description of the phrase + gestures, links to your five examples (include beginning and end times), and a little bit of annotation of what you find. Nota bene: your work may be reposted to a Red Hen data page and is likely to be used by future researchers, so be as considerate of them as possible.  Tell them exactly what you think they will need to know.  Also say on your blog whether I may attribute this work to you **by name**. If you say yes, the entire world will see it.  But that's the idea: in research, the researcher takes responsibility.  Next, visit [https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-data-requests/home](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-data-requests/home&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1742010531790021&usg=AOvVaw2CjiwYBZ0GFM_FgeDbg_2I) and request at least two working clips (corresponding to two of the five examples you listed on your student page) in exactly the format required; include start and stop times. The robot will send you your clips if you ask in the right way. If you are having trouble getting videos to play in the Edge Search Engine, see the troubleshooting section at this page: [https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/home/tutorials-and-educational-resources/access-for-members](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/home/tutorials-and-educational-resources/access-for-members&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1742010531790021&usg=AOvVaw2OHMl6xDJ4RDWs7AolYqkK)
