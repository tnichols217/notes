# Design of Research Project

## Prompt

One way to do a project is to think of testing a hypothesis. We have already discussed this homework assignment in class. Post on your blog a design of a research project with the following parts:

1. A research question or hypothesis having to do with cognition and computation.
2. Data that could help test this question or hypothesis.  Does it exist? Where would you get it?
3. Thoughts about how to tag (if tagging is needed) and search this data to produce a comma-separated-value file of results.
4. Calculations that you would do in R on the data that is contained in this comma-separated-value file so as to produce some results.
5. A visualization of these results.

Comments: Designing a research project rarely goes sequentially through these 5 parts. Perhaps there is no way to get the data you need; perhaps you begin with the data and wonder what question could be tested against these data; perhaps there is a visualization tool you are interested in and so go looking for the other parts that would let you use that tool. Etc.  You know a lot about visualizations already: graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc. R offers a range of visualization tools: see [https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/guide-data-visualization-r/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/guide-data-visualization-r/&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1740675891027875&usg=AOvVaw3ZrTyhFXUe2KaO2dR0HCVw). Visualization is important not only for communicating with others but also for helping you grasp your own data and results.

## Response

I would like to research how our encoded ways of thought in self prompting AI models differ from the ways humans in daily life think.

Data for this would likely be scarce, but this research question isn't about hard and statistical data, it is much softer and behavioral in nature, thus gaining an understanding of general patterns is much more significant than just numbers.

Once again, it would be hard if not impossible to get hard data for this question, and thus having visualizations would be counter to the point of this question.
