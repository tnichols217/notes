# First Small Paper Ideas

## Prompt

Post 150 words on your student page outlining a topic for your first small paper, which is due Friday of week 6. We’ll discuss this in class. You will write two small papers and have one big project. Our three fields are _theory, models, tools._ Your project will be in one of those fields. Your first small paper will be in one of the other two, and your second small paper will be in the remaining unselected field.

## Response

Large language models have increasingly become a source of cognitive assistance for humans in recent years. From computational tasks such as those in STEM fields to artistic or philosophical thought, LLMs have offered an additional perspective and avenue for the masses when attempting to analyze or think about anything. In the areas of cognition and computation, LLMs are a prime example of how the fields intersect — through large amounts of initial computation, we are able to simulate a very basic cognitive entity in order to aid our own cognition — but with super-human access to information. LLMs have already changed the landscape of human cognition. I believe in the coming years, a monumental shift on how humans approach thought and the concept of genuine original idea systems will happen in a manner that highlights the unique thought processes of humans by reducing the importance of lesser important tasks that may instead be automated by such models and tools.
