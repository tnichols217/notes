Throughout the process of working on my final project, I have been reading and understanding a lot of different preconditions for the utilization of human thought. The main goal of my project, as previously explained, is to see what makes human thought different from how we utilize computers, and if human thought is capable of so much, what can we do to allow computers to be able to process things in a way that would reap the benefits of human thought? After reading multiple papers on the methods of human cognition, I have came up with a few processing pipelines that are both represented in my second small paper and in the thought models I have implemented within my final project. At this point, I plan to continue researching and understanding different thought models that I may continue to implement additional thought processes to my final project.
