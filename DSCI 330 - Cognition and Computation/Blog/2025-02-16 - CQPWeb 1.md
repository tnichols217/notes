# CQPWeb 1

## Prompt

Study cqpweb-simple-syntax-help.pdf from Permanent Resources to learn the rudiments of using CQPweb to find linguistic patterns. For example, consider the form-meaning pair named "the Xer the Yer. Comparative correlatives," for expressions such as THE CLOSER THIS FRONT GETS, THE STRONGER THE COOL MOIST ONSHORE FLOW. One could search in CQPweb for this using simple query syntax with the query

     the (_JJR | _RBR) *************** the (_JJR | _RBR)

If you change the Query mode to “CQP syntax” you can run the better query

     "the" [pos="JJR|RBR"] []* "the" [pos="JJR|RBR"] []* [pos="\."] within s

Now post on your blog: examples of some linguistic pattern you find interesting (not just a string, but something with grammatical structure), and a query you have designed that you could use in CQPweb to search for that pattern. Then issue the query in CQPweb, adjust the query as needed, and post some results on your blog. To reach CQPweb

1. Visit [https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/newsscape/newsscape/](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/newsscape/newsscape/)
2. Select [NewsScape v5](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/newsscape/newsscape_05). Log in using any of the usernames redhenstudent1, 2, … 25 and as password the enrollment key that Turner told to you. Ask for it via email if you do not have it.
3. Very important: After logging in, navigate to this address: [https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/newsscape](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/newsscape) . (If you try instead to navigate via the menu offered after the login, you will end up in standard CQPweb and not have the video links and the modified downloads.)

Even more important: The tutorial cqpweb-simple-syntax-help.pdf has examples for a corpus that uses the C6 tagset. But the NewsScape CQPweb uses the [Penn Treebank tagset](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html), a link to which you find on the last page of the simple query syntax help. So you must adjust to the Penn Treebank tagset. More information on the Penn Treebank tagset is [here](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/data/Penn-Treebank-Tagset.pdf).
