# Distant Thoughts About Projects

> [!question] 
> Post 250 words on your blogÂ  (see instructions above) describing your interest in the course: what topics might you want to pursue for your final project? When you post to your blog, always quote the assignment that motivated the post, and post in reverse chronological order, i.e. most recent first.

As mentioned in my first blog post here on 01-13, I am particularly interested in investigating the differences between state of the art implementations of general artificial intelligence in the field and our own methods of thought in humans. I was particularly intrigued by this primarily due to the title of this course: *Cognition and Computation*, and what better way of imitating cognition through computation than with our own applications of general artificial intelligence.

I plan to investigate this niche by learning the models of thought that we will cover in this class, both on a lower level, and on a higher applications level of thought. Understanding how learning is done in humans is paramount to creating a digital system that can learn as well, but it is for nothing if not for the higher level applications of thought and meta-thinking that is necessary to both create and truly "know" things. Maybe the problem of originality with modern AI isn't that of learning but that of application.

As much as I believe human thought and unique and important for learning a system of thought and understanding, I am also equally intrigued by the thought of other methods of learning. Coming from a background of both computer science and art, I am always open to trying to understand and learn new paradigms as evident in my life though my course workload, hobbies, and even culture. Perhaps one day I will learn of a way to learn that fundamentally surpasses what humans are capable of.
