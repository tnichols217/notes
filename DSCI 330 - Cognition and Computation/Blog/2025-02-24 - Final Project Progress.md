# Final Project Progress

## Prompt

Post 250 words on your blog about your progress in selecting, designing, and completing a final project.

What will you produce, build, deliver? What is your workflow for doing so? Be specific: what are the parts of the work, how will you do it, how will those individual accomplishments result in a whole? How can your network help? What do you need?

## Response

I have not made any progress as to the project itself, but the project structure is finalized as a survey of human thought processes, in order to compile them into structured steps and procedures that may be later implemented and interpreted by machines. I plan to look for as many research papers as possible explaining the process of human thought in various circumstance in order for me to draw both a general conclusion of the process of human thought, but also domain specific conclusions for specialized AI models. Then, if time permitting I will create a series of self-prompting models that will utilize model chatbots and test if the reasoning sufficiently does better than the raw prompt.

I plan to deliver a set of prompting models and maybe a self-hostable chatbots with these prompts designed into the model. The primary deliverable will be the prompts and the results of the research itself, and not the chatbot however, as modes of thought are model-agnostic. My main workflow is to read papers, take notes, and after reading sufficient papers, write a series of prompts, then implement them into a chatbot.
