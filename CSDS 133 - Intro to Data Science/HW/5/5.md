# 5: Pairwise Association

## 1

The director of Gainesville Sun newspaper is studying the relationship between the type of community in which a subscriber resides and the section of the newspaper he or she reads first. For a sample of readers, she collected the sample information in the following table:

|        | National News | Sports | Comics |
| ------ | ------------- | ------ | ------ |
| City   | 170           | 124    | 90     |
| Suburb | 120           | 130    | 100    |
| Rural  | 130           | 90     | 88     |

### a

At the $95\%$ confidence level, can we conclude that there is a relationship between the type of community where the person resides and the section of the paper read first, i.e. are they dependent?

### b

What is the largest chi-square value? How would you interpret this?

> [!answer]
> The largest $\chi^{2}$ value was $3.1483254$, which means that this particular value was highly unexpected â€” where our expectation was that there is no dependency between the two variables. This means that this variable in particular does not fit the trends of both variables that are intersecting here.

### c

Is the number of people that read national news in rural areas greater or less than expected?

> The amount of people that read national news first in rural areas being $130$ was larger than the expected number of people that would, at $124.14587332$ people.

### d

Is the number of people that read comics in cities greater or less than expected?

> [!answer]
> The amount of people that read comics first in cities being $90$ was less than the expected number of people that would, at $102.44913628$ people.

The Federal Correction Agency is investigating whether a male released from a prison make a different adjustment to civilian life if he returns to his hometown or if he goes elsewhere to live? To put it another way, is there a relationship between adjustment to civilian life and place of residence after release from prison?

The counts are given in the following contingency table:

|              | Outstanding | Good | Fair | Unsatisfactory |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---- | ---- | -------------- |
| Hometown     | 27          | 35   | 33   | 25             |
| Not Hometown | 13          | 15   | 27   | 25             |

At $99\%$ confidence can we conclude that adjustment to civilian life and residence after release are dependent?

In this exercise, our aim is to quantify the associations between continuous variables and assess the statistical significance of these associations. For this purpose, we will use the two datasets that are provided with the assignment:
- The file `p3a.csv` contains a matrix of size $2400 \times 2$ which has $2400$ samples and $2$ variables.
- The file `p3b.csv` contains a matrix of size $110 \times 2$ which has $110$ samples and $2$ variables.

### a

For the two variables provided in `p3a.csv`, assess the association between them by computing Pearson correlation $r_{a}$ and computing a $p$-value $p_{a}$ for the null hypothesis of no association. Select a significance level $\alpha$ and reject the null-hypothesis if the $p$-value is less than $\alpha$. Explain, in complete sentences, your findings: Is there a statistically significant association (at $\alpha$ level) between the provided variables? What is the magnitude and the direction of the association?

> [!answer]
> $r_{a}=0.38087503578373005$
> $p_{a}=1.0409455130062538\times 10^{-83}$
> 
> At an alpha level of $\alpha=0.01$, we can statistically reject our null hypothesis that there is independence between the two variables, as our $p_{a}=1.04\times 10^{-83}$, making it statistically significant.
> 
> However, our $0.5>r_{a}>0$, so it has a relatively weak association, but it is a positive association. In a linear regression we also obtain a slope of $0.5675\pm0.0281$, which supports our $r_{a}$ value as well.

### b

Repeat part (a) for the variable pair provided in `p3b.csv` and compute Pearson correlation $r_{b}$ and $p$-value $p_{b}$. Compare the Pearson correlations $r_{a}$ and $r_{b}$ as well as the p-values $p_{a}$ and $p_{b}$. Explain your findings: Which variable pair (in part a or b) has a stronger association according to the comparison of the correlations? Which variable pair has a stronger association according to the comparison of the $p$-values?

Next, draw scatter plots (variable 1 vs. variable 2) to visualize the data for both part (a) and part (b). Which variable pair (in part a or b) has a stronger association do you think according to the scatter plots? Does your conclusion agree with the comparisons of the $p$-values and correlation coefficients? If not, explain why would this happen.

> [!answer]
> $r_{b}=0.9312196333264214$
> $p_{b}=3.73732100843862\times 10^{-49}$
> 
> At an alpha level of $\alpha=0.01$, we can statistically reject our null hypothesis that there is independence between the two variables, as our $p_{b}=3.74\times 10^{-49}$, making it statistically significant.
> 
> However, our $r_{b}>0.9$, so it has a strong positive linear association. In a linear regression we also obtain a slope of $0.6259\pm0.0236$, which supports our $r_{b}$ value as well.
> 
> Our $p_{b}$ value is significantly larger than our $p_{a}$ value, although still significant to the point of disproving the null hypothesis of independence. This $p$-value has no significance other than either disproving the null or being inconclusive, so these $p$-values are effectively the same, as they show association of some kind.
> 
> Our $r_{b}$ value, however, is significantly higher than our $r_{a}$ value. This is because our data is much more clustered and linearly related than our first dataset. This agrees with the visual characteristics of the data, as the first one looks like a shotgun blast, but the second one actually looks linearly related.
> 
> The plots do agree with the changes in both our $r$ and $p$-values.
