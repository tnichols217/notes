# Proofs and Mathematical logic

**Any statement as a math object is a logical value: a constant or a function**

- Statements can be true or false (boolean)
- Logical functions are often of the form $f(x)=y$
- Sets are denoted with curly braces and are unordered $\{\}$ or rules

## Logical Operations and Relations

**Unary Operations**: Input -> Output
**Binary Operations**: Input1, Input2 -> Output

$a\iff$
