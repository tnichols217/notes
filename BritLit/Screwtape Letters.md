# Letter 4 - Ethereal Utterances
```col
> [!quote]
> "This is exactly the sort of prayer we want; and since it bears a superficial resemblance to the prayer of silence as practice by those who are very far advance in the Enemy's service, clever and lazy patients can be taken in by it for quite a long time" (Lewis 16).
```
```col
> [!info] Blurb
> I found this particularly jabbing because I didn't really consider my own posture when I am praying and this was particularly contradictory to me. It didn't even cross my own mind that it might be bad prayer (according to CS Lewis) if I didn't watch my posture. Even though this chapter was about praying to things other than God and everything that could and would distract us from that, this off remark about posture caught me by surprise.

> [!important] Application
> Now that I am more awake of what could be distracting during prayers, I will take additional steps to ensure that not only my mind is ready to pray, but my bodily posture as well.

# Letter 11 - Positively Fantastic Recovery

```col
> [!quote]
> "Mere cowardice is shameful; cowardice boasted of with humorous exaggerations and grotesque gestures can be passed off as funny. Cruelty is shameful -- unless the cruel man can represent it as a practical joke. A thousand bawdy, or even blasphemous, jokes do not help towards a man's damnation so much as his discovery that almost anything he wants to do can be done, not only without the disapproval but with the admiration of his fellows, if only it can get itself treated as a Joke" (Lewis 55-56).
```
```col
> [!info] Blurb
> This quote was quite interesting because it shows how harmful jokes can be. It also shows multiple sides of the same problem, like how without making it into a joke people will see and treat you differently. It definitely makes me aware of what I should and shouldn't be joking about.

> [!important] Application
> This makes me more cautious about what I'll joke about and possibly rethink what I have joked about in the past.

> "The woman is in what may be called the 'All-I-want' state of mind. *All* she wants is a cup of tea properly made, or an egg properly boiled, or a slice of bread properly toasted. But she never finds any servant or any friend who can do these simple things 'properly' -- because her 'properly' conceals an insatiable, palatal pleasures which she imagines she remembers from the past; a past describe by her as 'the days when you could get good servants' but known to us as the days when her seenses were more easily pleased and she had pleasures of other kinds which made her less dependent on those of the table" (Lewis 88-89).

> This quote stuck out to me because I normally find this kind of behavior very stuck up and Karen-like, but this time I found it oddly relatable. It was probably the simplicity of the items she was requesting but failed to obtain that made me sympathize with her on some level. Although I still despise the behavior the expects other people do act and work for you, I still feel like there is something I can learn from this incidence.
