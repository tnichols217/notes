# Letter 4 - Ethereal Utterances

> "This is exactly the sort of prayer we want; and since it bears a superficial resemblance to the prayer of silence as practice by those who are very far advance in the Enemy's service, clever and lazy patients can be taken in by it for quite a long time" (Lewis 16).

It didn't even cross my own mind that it might be bad prayer (according to CS Lewis) if I didn't watch my posture. Even though this chapter was about praying to things other than God and everything that could and would distract us from that, this off remark about posture caught me by surprise.

> Mere cowardice is shameful; cowardice boasted of with humorous exaggerations and grotesque gestures can be passed off as funny. Cruelty is shameful -- unless the cruel man can represent it as a practical joke. A thousand bawdy, or even blasphemous, jokes do not help towards a man's damnation so much as his discovery that almost anything he wants to do can be done, not only without the disapproval but with the admiration of his fellows, if only it can get itself treated as a Joke.
