### 1 - Beowulf
> [!quote] 
> "The celebration that followed that night was one of the grandest Hrothgar's hall had seen. The cooks labored from dawn till duck under Ashhere's supervision, and the singers and tale-tellers and other entertainers were summoned. Extra ale was begged from smaller villages and halls nearby, and two of the finest prize pigs were chosen to be roasted for the centerpiece of the feast in Beowulf's honor. Grendel's torn stump was sewn up and nailed above Hrothgar's seat for all to see -- the cooks' helpers spent almost as much time chasing wide-eyes children away from this freakish sight as they did stirring and chopping and fetching and carrying" (Raven 24-25).

> "As it fell, its mouth opened, and Beowulf spilled out, his body broken and bleeding. I crawled -- it was the best I could do -- over to where Beowulf lay and took his hand. To my astonishment his eyes opened, and he turned his head a fraction and smiled weakly at me.
> "It is over," he said.
> "Yes," I assured him, "the beast is dead."
> "Not the beast," choked Beowulf, coughing up bloody spittle as he spoke. "Me. I am done. It is over"" (Raven 66).

> ""But you know my history, my lord kind," said the warrior Beowulf, inclining his head respectfully toward his master. "There is blood-debt to be paid here. My honor says I must go..."" (Raven 14).


### 2 - Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
> [!quote] 
> ""Would you grant me the grace," said Gawain to the king,
> "To be gone from this bench and stand by you there,
> If I without discourtesy might quit this board,
> And if my liege lady misliked it not,
> I would come to your counsel before your court noble.
> For I find it not fit, as in faith it is known,
> When such a boon is begged before all these knights,
> Though you be tempted thereto, to take it on yourself
> While so bold men about upon benches sit,
> That no host under heaven is hardier of will,
> Nor better brothers-in-arms where battle is joined;
> I am the weakest, well I know, and of wit feeblest;
> And the loss of my life would be least of any;
> That I have you for uncle is my only praise;
> My body, but for your blood, is barren of worth;
> And for that this folly befits not a king.
> And 'tis I that have asked it, it ought to be mind,
> And if my clain be not comely let all this court judge in sight"" (Borroff 117-134).
