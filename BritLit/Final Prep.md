1. **Text to Context**: *Pick one text you studied this year and analyze how it was influenced by the time period in which it was written*. Our guiding lens for this semester was "Historical events impact cultural ideals/values which are then seen in entertainment. Your answer should explain this progression/relationship for the text of your Historical lecture notes and videos are all linked in DISCourse to help you review and plan your writing. You can do other research, as well, if that helps. A strong answer will refer to at least two specific elements of the text that are influenced by the historical context-you can think about plot, characters, themes, setting, intended audience, language, genre, or other elements of the text. Your answer must include one direct quote, integrated correctly into your writing and with a correct parenthetical citation. (~3/4 page)
   
2. **Text to Theme**: *Pick one text to use to discuss your assigned theme for this semester*. Some ideas you might cover How did that text demonstrate your theme? What do you think the author was trying to communicate about your theme? Did they do it well? Poorly? How did the time period in which the text was written influence how the theme showed up in the text? How might this story show us something relevant for today regarding this theme? A strong answer will consider the text as a whole, showing how the story. characters, setting, plot, etc. all work together to show the theme. Be thoughtful and strategic in making a strong argument in this answer-be confident, not wishy washy. Your answer must include one direct quote, integrated correctly into your writing and with a correct parenthetical citation. (~3/4 page)

3. **Theme to Self**: *Reflect on how your assigned theme applies to your life today*. You did this at the start of this semester, but this reflection should incorporate thoughts on how the texts we read and experiences you've had in the last 4 months have shaped your views on how this plays out in the real world. A strong answer will refer to specific texts we read this semester but does not necessarily need to include direct quotes (although you can if you'd like!) (~1/2 page)
