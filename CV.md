## Summary

I am a young driven software developer interested in gaining experience in any related field. I have experience in multiple areas such as both front and backend web development; plugin development; docker, docker-compose orchestration, and nix declarative environments; and python scripting and beginning neural networks. I have been maintaining a plugin I developed myself, called [obsidian-columns](https://github.com/tnichols217/obsidian-columns/), for just over 3 months, dealing with issues and development as the sole developer. I also developed a simple multiplayer, server-side rendered game: [orthello](https://github.com/tnichols/orthelloServer/) as a practice of combining multiple ideas: server-side rendering, multiplayer, and http over SSL.
