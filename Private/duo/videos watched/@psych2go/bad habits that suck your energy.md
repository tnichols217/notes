- binge watching, high intensity emotions lead to mental fatigue
- shallow breathing, deep breaths give more oxygen for you to function
- planning too far into the future, balance is important. what's going to happen isn't more important than what's happening in the present. 
- procrastination, lots of ignored things will become a huge thing, just like your assignments and in the end you get nothing done
- staying indoors too much
- slouching
- less water intake, dehydration
