Issie runs over to the side of Teb and looks down onto his sandy face.

Teb's breathing is slow and irregular, sometimes fast sometimes slow.

"Whats wrong?" a little inquisitive Issie asks.

Teb's eyes flutter open, not knowing that someone was staring at him in his rest. He scrambled to sit upright, scared that his parents came out to scold him. 

"I- uh I'm fine. Theres nothing? Why- what- who are you?"

Issie's head cocks slightly to one side, intrigued by the little boy's mannerisms. Issie inspects the boy from side to side, looking deep into his eyes trying to understand whats going on.

"I'm Issie"

Issie's head is still cocked to one side with a small smirk on her face. Teb's shocked look faded off his face, replaced my mutual intrigue.

"I'm Teb. Why are you here?"

"I thought you got hurt cuz you fell over"

"Oh no I was just resting"

Teb pulls his little foot in a bit, blood gushing out in small pumps out of the cut on the top of it. Issie glances down and sees the blood. Her eyes widen a bit before she looks away quickly.
