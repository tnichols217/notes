Hi booboo!

I want to just start by thanking you so much for everything you've done for me and I hope this adventure brings you joy and that you'd enjoy the work I put in to make this :]

Even just studying with you in call brings me so much happiness. I wish we can spend more and more time with each other going forward. I just wanna say I love you so much! And it won't stop <3 Without further ado, lets begin this adventure :]

Once upon a time there was a little girl named Issie and a little boy named Teb. Teb was sitting down in a sandbox and playing by himself. He took his shovel and dug a bit but he accidentally dug into his foot and he made a soft grunt, scared to show any sign of weakness because his parents were nearby. Miniscule tears dripped slowly from his wide eyes down his face as he forced a smile. He took the shovel out of the ground and set it on the floor next to his as he laid back in the sand and closed his eyes. His cute little smile faded into his natural resting bitch face as he thought about all the pressures the world put on him even as a little kid, being forced to study all the time and never game even when his friends asked him to. He laid back and sobbed a little on the inside but refused to let it show to anyone.

A voice rang out across the yard, "Teb? Where are you?"

Teb sat up and plastered on his smile back onto his face as he turned around to look at his mom.

"Here mum!"

"Come in, its getting dark and you need to study"

Teb walked home and learned some middle school math even though he was just an elementary student. Sooner or later he drifted to sleep.

Teb's vision brightened. His eyes focused on the ceiling as he rolled out of bed and stood on his chubby feet. Teb waddled out of the house, his parents still sleeping, and sat down in the grass near the sandbox staring out into the forest just a few meters away.

Issie notices Teb walk out of his house in the morning and their eyes meet. Teb notices but collapses into the grass and closes his eyes.
