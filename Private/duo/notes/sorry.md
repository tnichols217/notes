> Hi baba I'm sorry for everything today I didn't mean to scare you and say all those mean things and I'm really sorry. I hope this paragraph can somewhat make up for it :(. Thank you for all the fun times we've had together, I'd never want those to end. Thank you for spending time with me thank you for making things for me thank you for loving me thank you for caring for me. There's so many things i should be thanking you for that i barely do and i feel like I've been neglecting that part a lot lately. I wanna say thank you for everything you've done and I'm sorry i haven't noticed them a lot lately. I'm sorry I'm always stressed and can't handle myself but also thank you for helping me stay alive and believing i can get through this i owe a lot to you.
> I know things might be tough for both of us right now but I promise promise promise that I'll be here to see you through the tough parts and be with you throughout it all. I want to help you however I can and i care about you and i just can't see you go. Even though both of us are super busy lately i wish we can find time to do more things together like the old days :( i still check here.fm once in a while hoping you've logged in but you haven't i ask to play Stardew with you but often you're busy and i wish we can watch more movies like minions together (and hopefully have out mics on cuz i wanna talk to you)
> I hope we can work things out and be with each other cuz i really miss you :( I'm sorry for everything sorry this paragraph wasn't too long but hopefully it'll be enough for you :(
