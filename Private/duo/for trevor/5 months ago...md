5 months ago today, i haven't met you yet.
why did you come so late ?
why did u show up after i got hurt ?

it wasn't your fault either. god just wanted to give the right timing to the right people that deserves it. 

do you know that you shine brighter than the stars in the sky ? 
do you know that i'm very proud of you ?

why does no one ever say how proud they are of you ? its disappointing. 
it's not fair when people ignore your effort and soon you think your efforts don't matter at all. 

you know i'm really glad i met you, i'm really glad people in the past fucked up so bad because if they didn't i wouldn't have met you. i would've been stuck with someone else
