you've taught me that when we apologize, we apologize directly for the things we've made mistakes on not the things we call ourselves for. 

most of the time i've told myself that i am not worthy of this and that but you made it seem like i was the one judging myself on a lone scale,
i never really understood that i should apologize directly instead of calling it names or calling myself names.

it's very healthy to know and realise there's someone who actually its willing to teach me and watch me grow.

i've never met someone who's so patient with me on a different level because it really makes me think how different it would be and how nice it would be for someone just to cross my head but i realised that the people who actually loves you, puts their mind in helping you and improve and watching you grow as an individual or grow together as a couple/ good friend in general
