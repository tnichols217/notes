# Vector Functions

$\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t), y(t), z(t)\rangle$ is an example of a vector-function as the result of the function is a vector

# Common Function Forms

## Lines

$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{P_0}+t\vec{v}$
Where $P_0$ is a point on the line and $\vec{v}$ is a vector parallel to the line.

## Practice
$\vec{P_0}=\langle4, 0, 8\rangle$
$\vec{v}=\langle1, 0, 1\rangle$

$\vec{r}(t)=\langle4, 0, 8\rangle + t\langle1, 0, 1\rangle$
