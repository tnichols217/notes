# Vector Functions

$\vec{r}(t)=\langle x(t), y(t), z(t)\rangle$ is an example of a vector-function as the result of the function is a vector

# Common Function Forms

## Lines

$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{P_0}+t\vec{v}$
Where $P_0$ is a point on the line and $\vec{v}$ is a vector parallel to the line.
- Multiplying $\vec{v}$ by any constant does not change the look of the function as the vector is still parallel to the line
- Moving $\vec{P_0}$ somewhere else on the line also does not change the output

### Practice

1. $\vec{P_0}=\langle4, 0, 8\rangle$
   $\vec{v}=\langle1, 0, 1\rangle$
   $\vec{r}(t)=\langle4, 0, 8\rangle + t\langle1, 0, 1\rangle$

2. $\vec{P_0}=\langle-2, 0, -2\rangle$
   $\vec{v}=\langle4, 3, 7\rangle$
   $\vec{r}(t)=\langle-2, 0, -2\rangle + t\langle4, 3, 7\rangle$
