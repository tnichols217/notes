Often unit axis vectors will have their own names.

| x                     | y                     | z                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **i**                 | **j**                 | **k**                 |
| $\langle1,0,0\rangle$ | $\langle0,1,0\rangle$ | $\langle0,0,1\rangle$ |

Normally they are formatted as bold, with ijk corresponding to a unit in the positive dir
