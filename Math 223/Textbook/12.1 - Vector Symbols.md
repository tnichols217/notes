# Vector Symbols
## Standard Basis Vectors
Often unit axis vectors will have their own names.

| x                     | y                     | z                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **i**                 | **j**                 | **k**                 |
| $\langle1,0,0\rangle$ | $\langle0,1,0\rangle$ | $\langle0,0,1\rangle$ |

Normally they are formatted as bold, with i, j, and k corresponding to a unit in the positive direction of the x, y, and z axes

## Unit Vectors
**e** represents scaling a vector such that the length or magnitude of it is 1.
$e_\vec{v}=\frac{\vec{v}}{\|v\|}$
