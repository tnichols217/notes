# Cadences
- **Musical puntuation that marks the end of a phrase**
- The second chord in a cadence should fall on a stronger note than the first
## Authentic Cadences
**Most final type of cadence**
### Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)
**Strongest, most resolute, and most basic cadence**
- Can be:
	- $V \rightarrow I$
	- $V^7 \rightarrow I$
- Most resolute
- Always in root position
- The melody also is the root of the chord for the $I$ Chord

### Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)
**Usually defined simply as any authentic cadence that is not a PAC**
These Cadences are close to being an AC, but breaks one of the rules.
#### Root Position IAC
- Similar to a PAC, but the melody is not the root
- Still:
	- $V \rightarrow I$
	- $V^7 \rightarrow I$

#### Inverted IAC
- Similar to a PAC, but one or both of the chords are inverted
- Can be:
	- $V^6 \rightarrow I^{inversion}$
	- $V^6_4 \rightarrow I^{inversion}$
	- $V^6_5 \rightarrow I^{inversion}$
	- $V^4_3 \rightarrow I^{inversion}$
	- $V^4_2 \rightarrow I^{inversion}$
	- $V^{inversion} \rightarrow I^6$
	- $V^{inversion} \rightarrow I^6_4$
	- $V^{inversion} \rightarrow I^6_5$
	- $V^{inversion} \rightarrow I^4_3$
	- $V^{inversion} \rightarrow I^4_2$

#### Leading-tone IAC
- Similar to PAC, but instead of a $V$, you have a $vii^o$
- Can be
	- $vii^{o} \rightarrow I$
	- $vii^{o7} \rightarrow I$
	- $vii^{o6}_4 \rightarrow I$
	- And other inversions of the $vii^{o}$ chord
		```music-abc
		X: 1
		M: 4/4
		L: 1/4A
		K: C
		|"vii*"[BDF]2 "I"[CEG]2|
		```

## Deceptive Cadence (DC)
**When the ear expects a $V\rightarrow I$ authentic cadence but hears $V\rightarrow X$ instead**
- $X$ is usually a $vi$ chord
- $vi$ because it has two notes in common with the $I$ chord
- Usually not to end the phrase but to **prolong** it a few more measures

## Half Cadence (HC)
**Very common type of unstable or “progressive” cadence**
**$X\rightarrow V$**
- $X$ is any other chord
- $X$ is normally $IV$ or $I$

### Phrygian Half Cadence
**Just the $iv^6\rightarrow V$ progression in a minor key**

## Plagal Cadence (PC)
**The $IV \rightarrow I$ progression**
- Often tagged on after a PAC
- Also known as the "**Amen**" Cadence
- Quite final sounding

# Musical Ideas
## Motives
- Motives are the **smallest identifiable musical idea**
- Can consist of a **pitch pattern**, a **rhythmic pattern**, or **both**
- Rythm tends to be more important
- **Light Motive** is a motive that represents something
		
	```music-abc
	X: 1
	T: Motive
	M: 2/4
	L: 1/8
	K: C
	|zG GG|_E6|
	T: Rythm
	M: 2/4
	|zG GG|G6|
	T: Pitch
	M: 2/4
	|G8|_E8|
	```

## Phrases
- Phrases are **independent musical idea terminated by a cadence**
- Subphrases are a portion of a phrase, but it is not a phrase because there is no cadence or it is too short
- A **subphrase is a melodic** event, whereas a **phrase is a harmonic** event
- Phrases are usually labeled with lowercase letters
	- Parallel relationship (in a parallel period) between phrases are labeled with a prime **'**
- A **repeated phrase** is a phrase that is repeated, and may have slight modifications
- An **allision** is when the end of a phrase is after the start of the next phrase

## Periods
- A period typically consists of **two phrases**
- Normally a question-answer relationship, a **weak followed by a strong** cadence
- Phrase endings need to be different, if not it is a **repeated phrase**
- Normally are:
	- $HC \rightarrow IAC\text{ or }PAC$
	- $IAC \rightarrow PAC$

### Types of Periods
- **Parallel Period** are when multiple phrases begin with similar musical material
- **Contrasting Period** are when they don't

### Multiple Periods
- A common way of expanding a two-phrase period is by repeating the antecedent phrase like **$aab$** or the consequent phrase like **$abb$** 
	- can repeat both like **$aabb$**
	- not the same as a repeated period **$abab$**
- **Three-phase periods** are periods made of three phrases (aka **phrase groups**)
	- Tends to be: **Strong, Weak, Strongest**, but can also be weak, strong, strongest
- A **double period** consists typically of **four phrases in two pairs**, with ending cadences of the phrases following the same weak-strong pattern
	- Like:
		- $HC \rightarrow IAC\text{ or }PAC$
		- $IAC \rightarrow PAC$
	- Each pair of phrases is **not** normally considered a period
	- The double period is normally **not** made of two periods
- A **repeated period** is just repeated periods
	- Made of two periods

## Sentences
- Sentences are an immediate repetition or variation of a musical idea followed by a motion toward a cadence
- Normally one or few phrases in length
