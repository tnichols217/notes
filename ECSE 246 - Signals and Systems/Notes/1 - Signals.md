# Signals

A **signal** is a set of data or information or physical quantity that varies along a dimension (typically time or spatial)

A **system** processes signals, modifying, extracting, or lifting information from them.

## LTIC

**LTIC**: Linear, Time Invariant, Causal

---

**Linear**: Only additive and multiplicative transformations or combinations of signals

**Time Invariant**: The transformation will be deterministic and non-dependent on when the transformation was made; a signal input at any time will output the same signal

**Causal**: Real world signals can only respond to and react to signals and data from the present and past; not the future

## Continuous vs. Discrete

Signals can either be continuous or discrete: where samples are infinitely resolute, or sampled at discrete time/spatial steps.

## Analog vs. Digital

Analog signals have infinitesimal resolution in the values of the samples, while digital signals have been **quantized**, where the values must be able to be represented digitally, meaning it may only take certain pre-defined values.

## SISO vs. MIMO

Single Input Single Output vs. Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs; the definition is quite obvious.
