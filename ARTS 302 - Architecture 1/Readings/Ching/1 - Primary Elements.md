# Primary Elements

Extending an element in a direction increases its **dimention**

## Dimentional Primitives

### Point

![[0 - Point]]

- Marks a position
- No ***size***, ***depth***, or ***area***
- Is **static**, **central**, and **directionless**
- Can mark **centers**, ends of lines, or corners
- Uncentered points create **aggression** and **tension**
  - Centered points creates **stability** and **rest**
- On a plan, points mark endings, openings, and columns

#### Point-like forms

![[0.5 - Point forms]]

- A point in 3D space can look like a circle, cylinder, or even a sphere. They have similar characteristics to points as marking areas as centers or to create tension.
- Two points creates both a line going **through** them and a perpendicular going **between** them

### Line

![[1 - Line]]

- lines **join**, **link**, and **surround** other objects
  - Articulate and contour surfaces
- Has no width or depth, but possesses a length
- Orientation
  - Vertical lines express equilibrium with gravity and mark points in space
  - Horizontal lines express stability and rest
  - Oblique lines express the rising or falling motion
- Lines can also outline a space or volume
- Lines can be imagined across symmetry
- Walkways also join and link 3D spaces
- Lines signify edges or a grid on a plan
- Texture depends on weight, spacing, and direction of lines

#### Plane forming lines

![[1.5 - Plane Forming Lines]]

- Two lines create an envisioned plane
- Multiple pillars can create a symbolic wall
- The bottom right graphic illustrates the transition between pillars and a wall
- Often walls of pillars are used as the the exterior facade of a building
- Walls of pillars both act as support and an example of how the area is semi-permeable
- Pillars also can act as a rhythmic measurement of space

### Plane

![[2 - Plane]]

- Planes are extended lines
- Use foreshortening to display angles
- Surface color, pattern, and texture effect visual weight
- Planes express limits of volumes
- There are three kinds of planes
  - Overhead Planes - roofs, ceilings
  - Wall Planes
  - Base Plane - ground, floor, support

#### Planar Elements

##### Overhead Planes

- Normally out of reach
- Can symbolize the sky or anything above
- Provides shelter
- Can form overhangs to provide outdoor shelter and relate heavier to the ground

##### Wall Planes

- Can be Exterior or Interior
- Establish boundaries
- Mold interiors
- Can be structural or a strong directional influence
- Define the qualities of space
- Walls enclose and provide privacy, while windows and doorways break isolation

##### Base Plane

- Provides support
- Can be a ground plane or a floor plane
- Can be stepped to fit the terrain

### Volume

![[3 - Volume]]

- An extended plane
- Consist of points, lines, and planes
- Can be solid or void
- Can be the space created internally, or the space taken up
