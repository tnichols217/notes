# Form

Form is the external appearance or structure of a work. It refers to the internal solid or just the surface of an object. It is primarily defined by shape, size, color, and texture.

## Properties of forms

### Visual Properties

#### Shape

The outline or silhouette of a form. Gives a rough understanding of its 3D shape.

- Primary means of recognition of a form
- Depends on visual contrast to the background
- To architecture shape matters for
  - Enclosing planes: floors, walls
  - Opening: doors, windows
  - Silhouettes of buildings

#### Size

The height, width, and depth of the form in comparison to the other objects around it.

#### Color

The hue, saturation, or just value of the form being depicted. In architectural drawings, they tend to just be a range of values to show 3D contour and shadows.

#### Texture

The visual and tactile property of a form given by the size, shape, arrangement, and proportion of the parts as well as the weight, sparsity, and type of stroke used to depict the form.

### Relational Properties

#### Position

The location of a form relative to other forms. Gives an idea of space or compactness depending on its relation to other pieces.

#### Orientation

The viewpoint of which the form is seen from. It effects what details are highlighted in the form.

#### Visual Inertia

The degree or lack of stability in a form. It created a perceived motion or resolution of position. It depends on rotation, position, and relation to gravity or other forces.

## Primary Objects

### Shapes

#### Circle

- Centralized structure
- Self centering
- Can induce rotary motion when things are placed across its edge

#### Triangle

- Signifies Stability
- Can be balanced in a precarious state

#### Square

- Represents rationality and pureness
- Rectangles are derivations of squares
- When flat or perfectly diagonal, it exists in a balanced state
- Otherwise, it is in a precarious state

#### Other regular shapes

- The pentagon and hexagon can be derivations of a circle, with certain equilibrium points

### Curved surfaces

- Expresses fluidity
- Symmetricalness expresses stability and equilibrium
-

### Solids

Shaped can be lofted, extruded, rotated, or revolved to form basic solids

#### Sphere

- The revolution of a circle
- Self centering in a 3D environment
- Can induce a movement when on an unlevel surface
- Remains the same from any viewpoint

#### Cylinder

- The revolution of a rectangle
- Stable if resting on a flat side
- Can also induce movement when on its curved surface and on a slanted surface

#### Cone

- Revolution of a triangle
- Stable on its base, unstable when tilted
- Induces movement when on its side
- Has equilibrium when directly on its point

#### Pyramid

- A loft from a polygon to a single point
- Stable on its base
- In balance when on its base or any plane
- Very angular

#### Cube

- Lacks movement or direction
- Stable on all sides
- Can be unbalanced when placed at a non-perfect diagonal

## Regular and Irregular Shapes

### Regular Shapes

- Any primitive shape
- Combinatiions of primitive shapes that maintain symmetricality

### Irregular Shapes

- A combination of forms that lacks symmetry
- More dynamic
- Can contain regular shapes, and regular shapes can contain it

## Shape Transformations

### Dimensional

- A modification of one or more dimensions of a form
- Tends to retain original identity
- Also includes shearing or scaling only a portion of a form

### Subtractive

- Created by subtracting a form from another form
- Retains individual identity, but not as much as dimensional transformation
- Sometimes the ground plane is the subtractive form
- Allows viewer to visualize the full form
- If edges are removed, identity is lost
-

### Additive

- Attaching or adding forms to connect to an already existing form
- Retains the least identity

#### Spacial Tension

- Some space is between the forms
- Often forms have a similarity between them that allows for recognition as a whole

#### Edge-to-edge contact

- Share a common edge
- Smallest form of "touching" forms
- Provides a pivot point

#### Face-to-face contact

- Shares a planar surface
- Connects the volumes

#### Interlocking volumes

- Volumes penetrate each others space
- Does not need shared traits for the addition to be felt

## Form Relationships

### Centralized

- Multiple sub-forms around a centralized main form
- Geometrically regular
- Dense and visually dominant
- Often require a primitive form as it is easily identifiable and self-centering

### Linear

- Multiple forms lined up in a straight line or bent curve
- May appear repetitive in nature
- Can define edges of spaces
- May be vertical like a landmark

### Radial

- Multiple linear forms radiating out from a core element
- Core is highly symbolic and a point of interest
- Can be grown into a network

### Clustered

- A group of forms set apart from the area through close proximity
- May or may not be touching each other
- Do not have geometrical regularity like a central form

### Grid

- Most often a square grid, but may take other shapes
- A series of forms organized in a grid-like shape
- Could be subtractive forms from a large form at a regular interval

## Articulation of Form

- Often is about how distinct edges in a form are
- Contrasting surfaces highly articulate form and edges
- Rounded corners reduce articulation

### Corners

#### Sharp corners

- Most common and simple
- Articulate corners
- Often highlights the volume as well

#### Positive features

- More strongly highlights the corner
- Less weight on the volume

#### One-sided opening

- Gives the idea of a passing wall
- Highlights the edge that does not get opened
- Weakens volume visualization
- Strengthens planar surfaces
- Weakens articulation of corners

#### Two-sided opening

- Strongly deteriorates articulation of corners
- Allows insight into the volume, but also deteriorates its presence
- Allows the mixing of volumes

#### Rounded corners

- Soften contours
- Decreases corner articulation
- Strengthens the definition of form

### Surfaces

#### Contrast in material

- Differing materials, colors, or textures highlights a surface
- Increases or decreases the weight of that surface

#### View

- Frontal views increase strength and weight of a surface
- Oblique views increase distortion and decreases visual weight

#### Relative Scale

- Things in vicinity give a sense of scale and grandness or an area or surface
- Windows or doors aid sense of scale
