# Sonata Form

Consists of three main sections in order:

1. **E** - Exposition
2. **D** - Development
3. **R** - Recapitulation

## E - Exposition

Consists of four main sections in order:

1. **P** - Primary Theme
2. **T** - Transition
3. **S** - Secondary Theme
4. **C** - Closing Zone

### P - Primary Theme

- Main theme of the piece
- Gets revisited often
- In the main key of the piece (is in tonic)

### T - Transition

- Short piece between the themes
- Often takes the key of the Secondary theme with the meter and rythm of the Primary theme

### S - Secondary Theme

- Often in a different key from the Primary theme (often dominant)
- Often different in both rythm and mood of the primary theme
- Also will be revisited often throughout the piece

### C - Closing

- Adds new material and solidifies the key of the secondary theme

## D - Development

Lengthier development of both themes of the piece. Often takes the key of the secondary theme

## R - Recapitulation

Appears to be very similar to the exposition, with slight simplifications and a return to the tonic.

### P - Primary Theme

- A re-visitation of the primary theme from the exposition
- Highlight of the recap
-
