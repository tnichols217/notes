# Augmented 6ths

## Italian

Simplest form of the national augmented 6th chords. Looks like a first inversion $\hat4$ chord or a $\hat6$ with an added $\hat6$. Typically resolves to a $V$ chord.

| Major         | Minor         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $\flat\hat6$  | $\hat6$       |
| $\hat8$       | $\hat8$       |
| $\sharp\hat4$ | $\sharp\hat4$ |

## French

Same as the Italian, except with an added $+4$ interval from the root ($\hat2$ tone).

| Major         | Minor         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $\flat\hat6$  | $\hat6$       |
| $\hat8$       | $\hat8$       |
| $\hat2$ | $\hat2$ |
| $\sharp\hat4$ | $\sharp\hat4$ |

## German

Same as the Italian, except with an added $\text{P}5$ interval from the root ($\flat\hat3$ in Major, $\hat3$ in minor).

| Major         | Minor         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $\flat\hat6$  | $\hat6$       |
| $\hat8$       | $\hat8$       |
| $\flat\hat3$ | $\hat3$ |
| $\sharp\hat4$ | $\sharp\hat4$ |

### Enharmonic equivalent

The German augmented 6th is also enharmonically equivalent to the $V^7$ chord in the $\flat\hat2$ key.
