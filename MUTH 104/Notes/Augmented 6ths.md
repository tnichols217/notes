# Augmented 6ths

## Italian

Simplest form of the national augmented 6th chords. Looks like a first inversion $\hat4$ chord or a $\hat6$ with an added $\hat6$. Typically resolves to a $V$ chord.

| Major         | Minor         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $\flat\hat6$  | $\hat6$       |
| $\hat8$       | $\hat8$       |
| $\sharp\hat4$ | $\sharp\hat4$ |
