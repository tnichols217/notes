> # Maple Leaf Rag
> 
> The Maple Leaf Rag is a ragtime piece composed by Scott Joplin and released in 1899. This was one of Scott Joplin's most well formulated compositions, which received much acclamation for its revolutionary rhythms, transitions, and themes. The Maple Leaf Rag aided Scott Joplin's goal of popularizing ragtime through its swing-like and upbeat melodies.

>Ragtime was originally a modification of a march but turned into its own distinct style because of its repetitive use of syncopation. It is most commonly written in $\frac{2}{4}$ but can also be written in $\frac{4}{4}$. Occasionally it can be written in $\frac{3}{4}$ and be called a ragtime waltz. Most commonly the form of a rag piece will follow the patterns of $AABBACCC'$, $AABBCCDD$, or $AABBCCA$, although the maple leaf rag does not follow one of these strictly.
