## Maple Leaf Rag

- Was in 2/4 with a AABBCCDD pattern with a bridge between B and C
- One of Scott Joplin's most famous and popular songs
- Contains a lot of V-I resolutions, each phrase ending with a PAC
- The melody has a lot of syncopation, giving a feeling of swing
- Very upbeat and happy, mainly in the major key with a few borrowed chords from the minor key
- Feels like a call and response somewhat, with themes opposing and agreeing with each other
- Contains only a piano, so there is not much layering apart from the two hands
	- The right hand plays the melody
	- The left hand primarily plays accompaniment but occasionally plays the melody on downbeats
- This song does not originally have lyrics, but often was performed with lyrics written by Sydney Brown, describing the story of a poor man who impresses a rich crowd with the maple leaf rag
- Was one of the first and most popular examples of ragtime, and is still a great and influential piece today
