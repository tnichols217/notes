Listen to Chopinâ€™s Prelude Op. 28, No. 4 and answer the following questions.

What do you think the mood of the prelude is?

> It seems to be quite menalcholic. It begins very uneasily and eventually develops into a deep sad reflection then returns to the same uneasiness from the beginning.

What musical tools does Chopin use in order to create the mood of this piece? (An example could be related to the rhythm, melody, and or harmony)

> He uses a lot of non-chord tones to give a feeling of uneasiness as well as a constantly descending bass line which to me feels like falling

Where is the high-point, or climatic moment of the prelude? Include measure numbers.

> I would say measures 16-18 are the climax to the piece, it is dynamically louder as well as more melodically interesting.
