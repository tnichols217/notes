# Ionic Compounds
- Don't form molecules
- Forms a lattice
- Normally a metal with a nonmetal
- Bonded by electrostatic forces
- Formulas are just ratios and not molecules

## Ionic Bonding
- Metals normally donate electrons whilst the nonmetal receives
- When naming or writing a formula, the more metallic species (also the cation) comes first ($\text{NaCl}$)
- Binary ionic compounds will be a most reduced ratio that is non-charged overall

## Naming Binary Ionic Compounds
1. Cation then Anion
2. Cation is just the parent elements name
3. Anion is named by taking the first syllable of the Anion and adding *-ide*
4. No prefixes

# Covalent Compounds
- Synonymous with molecular compounds
- Nonmetals bonded to nonmetals
- Electrons are shared between atoms
- Electrons clump between the atoms

## Naming Covalent Compounds
- More metallic is names first
- Second element is named with an *-ide*
- Prefixes must be used to denote quantities
- *mono-* is not necessary for the first element

# Organic Compounds
- Carbon containing compounds (minus $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{CO}$)

# Acids / Bases
- Acids donate $\text{H}^+$ whilst Bases receives

## Acids
- If the first symbol is a Hydrogen it tends to be an inorganic acid
- If it ends with a **COOH** it tends to be an organic acid

### Acids without Oxygen
- Name it by starrting with *hydro-* and ending it with *-ic acid*
- Only an acid if it is in aq state

### Acids with Oxygen
- If the anion ends in *-ate*, change it to *-ic acid*
- If the anion ends in *-ite*, change it to *-ous acid*

### Organic Compounds
- 1 carbon: *meth-*
- 2 carbon: *eth-*
- 3 carbon: *prop-*
- 4 carbon: *but-*
- 5 carbon: *pent-*

# Common compounds with names
- Water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$)
- Ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$)
- Ozone ($\text{O}_3$)
