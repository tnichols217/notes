- Bonded by electrostatic forces
- Formulas are just ratios and not molecules

# Covalent Compounds

- Nonmetals bonded to nonmetals
- Electrons are shared between atoms
- Electrons clump between the atoms

# Organic Compounds
- Carbon containing compounds (minus $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{CO}$)

# Acids / Bases
- Acids donate $\text{H}^+$ whilst Bases receives

# Compounds with common names
- Water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$)
