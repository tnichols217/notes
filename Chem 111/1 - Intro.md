# Structure - Function connection
All chemicals have a strong structure function connection, where structure directly impacts the function and usage of the molecule or chemical

# Energy of Excitation
## UV/Vis
A machine that can measure intensities of the colors of the visual spectrum

## X-ray Spectroscopy
See the electronic structure of molecules by using X-rays.
It can measure where electrons are and move to when excited.

# Dimensional Analysis
If we know that $1\text{yard}=3\text{feet}$. Then we can create a fraction that is equal to 1:
$1=\frac{1\text{yard}}{3\text{feet}}=\frac{3\text{feet}}{1\text{yard}}$

# Density and Temperature
$\text{Density}=\frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$
Temperature is the average kinetic energy within the substance, always use $K$

# Sigfigs
Leading 0's do not count towards sigfigs
Captive zeroes
