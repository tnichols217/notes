# Percentage Composition

- What percentage of the mass of a compound is made up of that element

# Empirical Formula

- The smallest simple whole number ratio between the elements of a molecule or formula unit

# Converting between Percentage Composition and Empirical Formulas

- Be sure to use atomic mass to convert between moles (empirical formula) and grams (mass percentage)
- Simplify the ratio to whole numbers for empirical formulas, and to a percentage for mass percentage

# Converting between molecular and empirical formulae

- Use information of the molar mass to scale the empirical formula to become the molecular formula

# Combustion Analysis

- Normally contain C, H and O
- Exhaust is $CO_2$ and $H_2O$
- The rapid addition of Oxygen to a compound
