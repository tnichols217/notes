# Units

A unit is a scale of which a measurement is made in

All answers and measurements should have units, with a few minor exceptions (like ratios)

## SI units

- mass: kg
- length: m
- time: s
- temperature: K
- substance: mol
- electrical charge: J

## Metric Prefixes

| name  | prefix | amount    |
| ----- | ------ | --------- |
| mega  | M      | $10^6$    |
| kilo  | k      | $10^3$    |
| deka  | da     | $10$      |
| deci  | d      | $10^{-1}$ |
| centi | c      | $10^{-2}$ |
| mili  | m      | $10^{-3}$ |

# Periodic Table

## Electronegativity

The lower and lefter an atom is on the table, the less electronegative it is, meaning it is more metallic

# Matter

## Substances

**Substance**: A kind of matter with uniform properties
**Atom**: Fundamental unit of a substance
**Molecule**: Two or more atoms held in specific shape by attractive forces
**Elementary Substance**: Substances made up of only one type of atom (with the same atomic number)
**Compound Substance**: Substance made with more than one type of atom
**Chemical Formula**: Elements listed with number of atoms as the subscript

- ie: $H_2O(l)$ or $NaCl(s)$

## Phases

There are three phases:

1. Solid - Definite volume and shape
2. Liquid - Definite volume but not shape
3. Gas - No definite volume or shape

## Properties

**Physical Properties**: Observed without change in composition of substance

- Melting point

**Chemical Properties**: Only evident if substance goes through a chemical change

- Combustion
- **Chemical Change** requires new substance before and after in order to measure a chemical property

## Mixtures
**Heterogeneous Mixture**: A mixture that has distinguishable parts
**H**
