# Solubility

- Like dissolves like (polars dissolve polars)
- Temperature
	- Gasses increase in temp => decrease in solubility
	- Solids and liquids, not a rule, but most increase in temp => increase in solubility
- Pressure increase in pressure => increase in solubility proportionally

## Rate of dissolution
- Strength of bonds
- Temp => higher faster
- Surface area => higher faster
- Stirring increases surface area
