# Sem 1 Final
## Requirements

The goal of senior Bible’s Christ and Culture class is to introduce you to the social, political and moral issues of our time, and to provide biblical answers whenever possible. As we have discussed, sometimes the Bible does not directly address an issue, and so we must develop a biblically-grounded moral compass to help us navigate those situations. For your final exam, you will be assigned **three** different questions that present problems that need biblical analysis. Answer each question according to the following guidelines:

1.  Propose a solution/answer to each of the three problems separately after you have performed a thorough biblical investigation that is logical and grounded in the truth of God’s word.
2.  Provide clear, contextual biblical evidence (from the Protestant Christian Bible) in support of your answer. Distinguish between direct and indirect references and their respective impact on the analysis. Report whether a clear biblical conclusion can be reached. If a clear biblical solution is not possible, explain how your moral compass helped you arrive at your answer.
3.  After an analysis of the biblical evidence, you should make a clear distinction (if any) between the biblical worldview and the secular worldview, noting in particular the differences that create tension.
4.  Your answers should be well-written in accordance with the essay-writing skills you’ve learned at Dalat.

I will be grading each question on a two-point scale for a possible maximum score of 6. Adherence to the above guidelines will result in full credit.

A **hard copy** of each question must be submitted no later than Wednesday Dec 14th at 11:59 AM. You may handwrite the answers or type them.

Guns are no more or less available today than they were in 1999. Yet, since the Columbine High School massacre that year, mass shootings in public places have steadily risen, with a mass shooting event occurring at an average of every 47 days in the last 4 years. What trends in our culture has led to this increase in mass shootings during this time period when availability to guns has remained the about the same or lower? Relate your answer to biblical truths.

I think that the rise of social media leads to a disproportionately large say from minority groups, including those that have somewhat immoral views. The modern joke culture also contributes to people becoming more violent and impolite as there are basically no lines to be drawn on what is and is not a joke when it is being inclusive in the modern age (even jokes on murder are acceptable in the modern age). This spread of violence through social media as well as the modern joke culture leads to more people committing acts of violence. Another thing that has taken a rise lately is the use of violent video games. Although I personally don't believe it induces me or my friends to become more violent, I can see why some people believe that hanging around certain habits would rub off onto you eventually, and violent video games may be not that different.

The Bible predicts that one day people will become violent and rebel against their parents, not only because they disagree with them but because they filthy and disgraceful.

“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God” (2 Timothy 3:1-4).

“There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men” (Proverbs 30:11-14).

“Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward” (Isaiah 1:4).

The Bible basically predicts that there will come a generation that will be violent and evil, and perhaps this is the beginning of that generation in America. Although this is not direct evidence that this is the cause of increased gun violence in America, I believe that due to the same factors earlier, the rise of social media, joke culture, and video games, may also promote disobedience to parents, which would cause the cascade of effects outlined in the Bible.

Wealth envy is a tool that political parties use to create class warfare. Thus, rich people (a small voting bloc) are demonized by a large voting bloc, sometimes fairly and sometimes unfairly. However, rich people tend also to be the biggest achievers in society and hold important jobs and positions of responsibility. Biblically speaking, what should our attitude be towards rich people, and being rich in general?



## 3
Assume that you support the death penalty in at least some cases, and that you are a judge with the power to sentence someone to death. Biblically speaking, what kinds of evidence would have to be present for you to feel comfortable going through with it? Also biblically speaking, what kinds of evidences should be de-emphasized or rejected?
