- Scientists used to think that a single mutation could produce a new trait that natural selection could act on
- Now we know that is naive and simplistic
- What we earn is that its better at selective optimization of small changes
- If every move in the right direction is rewarded and it can move across a continuum, then it works for small things like that
- If a gene is completely broken, it cannot continue to ascend the gradient of functionality
- Moving along a continuum is completely different than creating a brand new function
