- Male reproduction system for evolution of whales is a big problem
- 100 mill years to produce a pair of mutations that are compatible
- only 9 mill was availiable to evolve the whale, but multiple big changes where each change is 100 mill
- The kinds of big changes need to be coordinated mutations - mutations together ot produce a trait
- mutation rate, effective population size, rate of reporduction, fixation time
- all mutations are random, one genome has billions of base pairs
- To achieve two coordinated mutations, it takes much longer than the life of the entire earth
- 6.48 billion years after new calculations
- waiting problem
