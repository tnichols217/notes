## **Why I Use Linux**
and why Mac and Windows just kinda suck

Why I use Linux and why mac and windows just kinda suck in comparison

But first off, what is Linux? Linux is a kernel (the thing that connects your hardware to the software running on your computer), build upon the GNU utilities. It is not an operating system, but operating systems can be build on top of Linux, like Ubuntu, or Arch Linux, which is what I use.

### **Philosophy**
Tech should be free and open

````col
```col-md
- Data should be **portable**
	- "Everything is a file"
- **Small** is beautiful
	- Each thing does one thing well
- You should have full **control**
	- Data is transparent
```
````

%%
Alright lets start off with what makes Linux different.
Fundamentally in the overarching philosophy of Linux, the main ideas are **portability** and **simplicity**, but also as a side effect, **control**.
Portability simply means that something can be taken from something and put into another. Practically, it means that everything works in a more modular type approach.
This means that almost any part of the system can be swapped out for something else if you don't like it. Don't like the program that loads your computer when you turn it on? Just change it. Don't like how your desktop looks? Install one that looks like a Mac or make it look like windows if you want to. 
This principle is best known in a popular quote in the Linux community "Everything is a file". In Linux, your physical hardware and whats in your computer are simply represented as files on your computer. Want to access something? Open the file. Not only does making everything a file allow ease of access to everything, but also functions as a way for completely different programs to communicate to each other: through files.
This principle also carries down into programs that you would use on your computer. All data stored, with respect to the Linux philosophy, is **interchangeable** and **transferable** across **all** programs of its calibre. This means that any word processor (like google docs for example), would save the files in the same format as every other program.

### **Technical Superiority**
How Linux is powerful yet lightweight

````col
```col-md
#### MacOS
Install: 16-35GB
Boot time: 12s
```
```col-md
#### Arch Linux
Install: 1-5GB
Boot time: 5-8s
```
````

- Optimised and modular architecture
- Industry Gold standard

%%
Next is simplicity. As I mentioned earlier, a modular approach is taken to handle portability. However, it too plays a role in simplicity as well. Each program should have one function and one function only. This allows that one program to get not only extremely good at that one thing, but also be small and optimised. This plays a large role in Linux's efficiency and speed in such a small package.

### **Open Source Community**
and why you should be a part of it

- Security
- Speedy Development
- Clean and optimised code

%%
Lastly, is control. In Linux, everything is under your own control if you want to. You could delete your whole computer in one command if you wanted to and nothing but yourself would stop you. In Linux, everything is open sourced, this means that the original code is available for anyone to read and fix, contrary to how Mac has all of this hidden. Having open source code allows you to verify that what you want to be running is actually running and nothing extra, like data collection or ads.

Other benefits of Open Source code include having a highly secure system, because all the code can be reviewed and fixed by anyone who wants to contribute. As compared to other operating systems where the code cannot be seen and will be hard to discover and fix a problem when it arises.

Open source code also promotes good coding procedures, like using code wisely and make it work well. If no one ever sees the code, such as in a proprietary manner like Mac, once something "just works" it will likely never get looked at again or made better, since the coders are merely paid to make the code work and nothing more.

### **How I came to know Linux**
and never looked back since

%%
How I came to know Linux
So this is weird actually cuz a long time ago I was tasked with setting up a minecraft server. And I had this old laptop lying around and no one was using it cuz it was old and crappy. At this time it was running Windows, so I just installed the minecraft server and set it all up with my internet and everything. And you know how like websites have names and the name will point you to some server somewhere in the world? Well in the residential zones, when you connect to the internet, your IP is different every time you connect. This is bad for a server because when you have the name of your website point to your IP, your IP changes and suddenly the website doesnt work. So since it was on windows i made this small program that would run every few seconds and update the IP so that the website would go to the right IP. This was a problem cuz even though it seems simple, it was taking up resources on this old crappy laptop cuz it was running like every second. So eventually I did some research and found this thing called linux. Since it was a server, I installed Ubuntu Server on it, my very first Linux install. A few things kicked me off as strange when I logged in. Well first off, if you wanna install something, theres like an App Store, and like the App Store actually has good apps that you wanna install, not like the windows store that people forget about half the time. So i open the app store and just install java and minecraft. Then i just ran it and it worked. It was that simple. And to update my IP for the website, there is a simple file you can make on the computer that will run every time your IP changes, which is convenient, cuz i just made it update the IP inside there, and it only runs whenever the IP changes. Other than that the minecraft server ran like 50% faster and it was just overall a more streamlined experience.

Then a few years passed and I started the get into programming and noticed that windows was a huge pile of crap and is like basically unusable if you want to program anything. So my reaction was to find something better, so I searched the internet for solutions, and it seems like Linux is the answer, so I search up which Linux distro to install, and people recommended Gentoo Linux. However, at that time what I didnt know was that gentoo linux was regarded as the hardest linux to install, so i installed it and it was great, but as I learned more about which things i can replace and change and update, i settled for the more simple and streamlined Arch Linux, which I still use to this day. Mainly because you can like actually update when you want, and like itll update while youre using your computer without even restarting, and since everything is on the app store, it also updates all your software too so its just really convenient, not to mention customizable.

### **Why Mac just isn't that good**

- Macs have a lot of bloat and features that you won't use
- There is a lack of customisation
- Requires expensive hardware to even access
- Limiting in terms of the variety of of things you can do with your system

%%
So lets get back to business
So, why mac just isnt that good ahem david. For one, theres not a solid app store, it doesnt allow you to customize much, takes up a lot of storage, is expensive, only runs on macs- like what if i want to run it on my own computer? Well i cant ohwell. And you simply do not get the freedom to do what you want with your computer as well as stopping me from just removing things I dont like or dont need.

### **Why Windows really sucks**

- Windows update?
- Why does my storage just slowly fill up and run out?
- Random BSOD?
- Why can I only change like one color in the whole system?

%%
And why windows reallllly sucks
Well for one: windows update, need I say more?
For two: why does my storage just slowly fill up even if I delete all my files then just run out? Like where did it all go?
For three: I plug in my laptop to the charger and it just gives me a blue screen of death. That stupid frowny face just looks at me. Like why are you here? What went wrong? I just plugged you in? My computer never crashed once on linux.
And like I cant even change the colors? What if I want to change the animation for something or have transparency or blur? Yeah not even possible in windows.
%%

### **Conclusion**

- Mac is ok, but only if you have money to throw at apple
- Windows sucks
- Linux is technologically superior

%%
Alllright conclusion
Mac is fine ig but only if you have a lot of money youre willing to spend, its not very customisable, but ig it is simple. It is big and getting bigger and you cant even run a minecraft server on it easily?

Windows just kinda sucks its slow and broken and just updates when youre in the middle of a comp

Overall, linux is just better, its faster, easier, more capable, and smaller
