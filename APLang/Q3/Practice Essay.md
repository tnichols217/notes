> Polite speech in Asian culture is deeply rooted into our customs and respect system. Whenever you visit someone's house you must greet everyone and recognize everyone that is there. These greetings are both to show respect and to create a time for you to start a conversation with people. Staying respectful and socializing with other people there is valued quite highly, and doing things on your own when other people are around is considered bad manners. Having polite speech helps both show respect by not keeping yourself alone and also communicated friendliness and willingness to talk.

> Polite speech is essential to showing respect in Asian culture. Whenever I visit any relative's house, most commonly my grandfather's, I must go around the place and greet everyone there, to let them know I've arrived and to show respect and recognition of their existence. This polite greeting is often accompanied with a small bow or handshake to further convey its meaning. Polite speech is not only found in greeting however, it often is used respectifully before meals, when you recieve anything from the hosts, or when you offer to help around. This polite gesture is important for maintaining their respect. When I do visit my grandfather's house, I always offer to help prepare the food, thank them for the meal, then offer to clean up afterwards. This polite speech serves not only to help the hosts lighten the load but to convey friendliness, thankfulness, and willingness to help around. Ultimately, this gesture comes down to showing respect.

Recognising everyone and individually saying hello to each person is also important. The greeting when seeing strangers is often more about being polite than respectful. The point of the polite speech is convey willingness to be there and to communicate friendliness to start off on the right foot. This initial greeting is one simple way to start a conversation with people as well. When I visited a family friend's house, greeting everyone, including the kids, was a quick way for me to join in the game they were playing. As well as joining the activities, I got to find out where the food was and what will be happening that night. The polite greeting is not only friendly, but functional.

Its meaning is not at all only literal, but more about communicating things that cannot be said meaningfully with words such as respect and friendliness. Polite speech in Asia serves a central role in how we communicate.
