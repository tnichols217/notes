# The importance of Modularity in techonolgy

### Thesis 
**Although modularity may introduce slight added complexity overall, its benefits greatly outweight its costs, not only in individual complexity but in sustainability, progressivity, and reusability as a whole.**



## Definitions
- Complexity can be defined as a function of the minimum number of individual parts needed in order for the system as a whole to function.
	- It is made up of multiple parts that interact in a nonsimple way
- Decomposabiliy may be part of the criterion of modularity in essence

## Modularity improves the maintainability of a system
- Ensures that no one person needs to understand the whole system to be able to make sure his part works
- Specialization at a particular thing: just get good at one thing, and focus on that. This is modularity in action, as many people work on their one specialized thing

	- The usage of the modern object-oriented software architectures and modularity as concept in the information technology industry is inevitable due to the great cost cut advantages. [costs] ✔
	- modularization allows the processing to be done in parallel by more than one processing core because the functionalities of the software application are from scratch designed to communicate in loosely coupled mode. [progress] ✖

	- Clearly, modularity is a design structure with a great many advantages. By reducing the degree of interdependency among, and thus the costs of communicating across, the parts of a system, it gives full rein to the many benefits of the division of labor among components. As usual, however, there is no free lunch. It turns out that modular systems are much more difficult to design than comparable interconnected systems. The designers of modular systems must know a great deal about the inner workings of the overall product or process in order to develop the visible design rules necessary to make the modules function as a whole. They have to specify those rules in advance. And while designs at the modular level are proceeding independently, it may seem that all is going well; problems with incomplete or imperfect modularization tend to appear only when the modules come together and work poorly as an integrated whole (Baldwin and Clark 1997, p. 86).

	- In a world of change, modularity is generally worth the costs. The real issue is normally not whether to be modular but how to be modular. (11) [conclusion] ✔
	- For example, the development of the OS/360 operating system for the original IBM 360 line of computers was evidently organized in a relatively nondecomposable way. The manager of the project, Frederick Brooks, insisted on a conscious attention to interdependencies and a high level of communication among all participants. This included the creation and maintenance of a formal project workbook that documented every aspect of the system so that, in principle at least, every worker could determine how changes elsewhere would affect his or her part of the project. Brooks decided “that each programmer should see all the material, i.e., should have a copy of the workbook in his own office” (Brooks 1975, p. 76). But within six months there was one small problem. “The workbook was about five feet thick! If we had stacked up the 100 copies serving programmers in our offices in Manhattan’s Time-Life Building, they would have towered above the building itself. [maintain] ✔

	- As shown in Table 7, we found support for the hypotheses, with additional presence of mediation. Although some relationships showed weak significance levels, nonetheless the sign indicated directional support. [about correlation of modularity and business performance] [costs] ✔

	- The standardized modules would decrease the cost of a new robotic manipulator and eliminate the possibility of obsolescence - the module can be upgraded when a better model becomes available. The small, standardized modules could be improved less expensively than a whole new robot arm, allowing the robotic industry to make "tech mods" rapidly and take advantage of the most advanced technology. The final result would be a rapidly growing, efficient industry whose impact on manufacturing would rival the impact of the microchip on the field of electronics. [cost] ✔
	- Portability of a robotic system implies that it can be broken down into pieces (or modules) small enough to be carried to the work place by a human operator and quickly assembled. [maintain] ✔
	- Failure in a robotic system might mean the high cost of total replacement. This maintenance objective would best be met by using robots made up of modules which could be easily replaced. Redundancy in some of the hardware components (sensors, encoders, local microprocessors, etc.) can be helpful. [cost] ✔
	- The modularity approach will allow aggressive upgrading programs to be pursued in almost all major areas. [progress] ✔

	- Modularity has enabled companies to handle this increasingly complex technology [complex] ✔
	- The fact that different companies (and different units of IBM) were working independently on modules enormously boosted the rate of innovation. By concentrating on a single module, each unit or company could push deeper into its workings. [progress] ✔
	- When IBM employed this approach and also made the new systems compatible with existing software (by adding “emulator” modules), the result was a huge commercial and financial success for the company and its customers. Many of IBM’s mainframe rivals were forced to abandon the market or seek niches focused on customers with highly specialized needs. [cost] ✔
	- If modularity brings so many advantages, why aren’t all products (and processes) fully modular? It turns out that modular systems are much more difficult to design than comparable interconnected systems. The designers of modular systems must know a great deal about the inner workings of the overall product or process in order to develop the visible design rules necessary to make the modules function as a whole. They have to specify those rules in advance. And while designs at the modular level are proceeding independently, it may seem that all is going well; problems with incomplete or imperfect modularization tend to appear only when the modules come together and work poorly as an integrated whole.
