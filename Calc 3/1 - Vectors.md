# Properties of Vectors

1. Has an **initial point** and **terminal point**, where the vector starts and ends
2. Has a **magnitude**, the length of the vector or the distance between the two points
   1. Can be calculated by using Pythagoras across the terminus
3. Vectors of the same components are equal, even if the initial points are different

# Operations with Vectors
1. Addition is simply the sum of the components of the vector
	1. The same as putting the tail onto the head of the other and drawing the vector from the first head to the last tail
	2. $$\begin{aligned}\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}\\ \vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}\end{aligned}\\\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}$$
2. Multiplication with a scalar just multiplies each component by the scalar
	1. $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}$
	   $c\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}ca\\cb\end{bmatrix}$
	2. If $c$ is negative, the direction of the vector flips and the magnitude multiplies by $c$
3. Subtraction of vectors is the same as addition, except the second operand is negated
	1. $\vec{v}-\vec{w} = \vec{v}+(-\vec{w})$

# Vectors in 3D space
## Right hand rule
Most commonly, for 3D space we follow the right hand rule. on your right hand when your hand curls it moves from $x$ to $y$, and when your thumb points up, that is $z$

## The Origin
The origin is the point at which all
