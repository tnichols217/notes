# Properties of Vectors

1. Has an **initial point** and **terminal point**, where the vector starts and ends
2. Has a **magnitude**, the length of the vector or the distance between the two points
   1. Can be calculated by using Pythagoras across the terminus
3. Vectors of the same components are equal, even if the initial points are different

# Operations with Vectors
1. Addition is simply the sum of the components of the vector
	1. The same as putting the tail onto the head of the other and drawing the vector from the first head to the last tail
2. Multiplication with a scalar just multiplies each component by the scalar
	1. $$\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}\\
	   c\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}ca\\cb\end{bmatrix}$$
	2. If c is negative, the direction of the vector flips
