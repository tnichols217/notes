# Learning Objectives

1. Learn the difference between medical technology as a subject area vs. as a career and how applications are:
   1. Imagined
   2. Designed
   3. Fabricated
   4. Used
2. Learn the difference between how med tech is interacted with by:
   1. Scientists
   2. Engineers
   3. Clinicians
3. Have a basic understanding of:
   1. Engineering design
   2. Structure-function relationships
   3. Biomimicry
   4. Biocompatibility
4. Have a basic understanding of subtopics:
   1. Biomaterials
   2. Biomechanics
   3. Biomedical Devices and instrumentation
   4. Biomedical computing and analysis
5. Apply the concepts in 3 to fields in 4
6. Understand if BME is an area of interest for me

> [!idea]
> Learn enough about BME to know if it is feasible as a career for me

## Design Project Requirements

Development process:

1. Team Contract
2. User Need
3. Brainstorming and Concept Generation
4. Concept Selection
5. System Architechture
6. Verification
7. Validation

# What is BME?

- Application of multiple fields of engineering to understand and solve biological processes and problems
- Works in intersection with
  1. Mechanical
  2. Electrical
  3. Computer Science
- Also includes
  1. Anattomy
  2. Physiology
  3. Biology
  4. Chemistry
  5. Mathematics
- Relatively new field, so there is a lot of investment and research being poured into it
  - More often devices are used to medicine now
  - More deterministic and applicable than chemical medicines
  - Improvement in assistive technologies (imaging, modelling)
  - More older people

## Engineering History

1. Civil Engineering - building shit for society
2. Mechanical Engineering - making and designing physical things, started because of steam power
3. Electrical Engineering - Studying the flow of electrons to solve issues
4. Chemical Engineering - Making fluids, chemicals, solvents to solve different problems
5. Biomedical Engineering - Combining literally everything else to solve problems in the body

# Where is BME going?

- Robotics and assistive technology
- Smart drugs
  - Targeted medicines
- Big data and analytical medicines
- Imaging and better representations for research
- Neural (or Brain Computer) interfaces
- Wearable Devices
