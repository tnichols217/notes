# What is BME
- Application of multiple fields of engineering to understand and solve biological processes and problems
- Works in intersection with
	1. Mechanical
	2. Electrical
	3. Computer Science
- Also includes
	1. Anattomy
	2. Physiology
	3. Biology
	4. Chemistry
	5. Mathematics

# Engineering History
1. Civil Engineering - building shit for society
2. Mechanical Engineering - making and designing physical things, started because of steam power
3. Electrical Engineering - Studying the flow of electrons to solve issues
4. Chemical Engineering - Making fluids, chemicals, solvents to solve different problems
6. Biomedical Engineering - Combining literally everything else to solve problems in the body
