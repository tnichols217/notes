# What is Engineering Design

1. Process of creating a system, design, or part to meet needs
2. Mostly uses an iterative approach to apply knowledge to problems and needs

# Design Process

## User Needs

The needs or problem that needs to be solved
Specifies the requirements of the process

### Solving ambiguity

Ensure that all requirements are solidly defined and specified
Later in the process, having well defined ideas are useful for organization
Need to move from words to numbers to strongly specify requirements

### Implementation

#### Qualitative

- Strong
- fast
- accessible
- durable

#### Technical Specs (Quantitative)

- Holds 100kg
- Less than 5$
- Can be accelerated to 5g

#### Categories

- Needs (MUST have)
- Wants (SHOULD have)
- Gee Wiz (COULD have)
- Also specifies what is safe and possible

#### User Empathy

Understanding the user and what they want from a perspective of what is possible

#### Design

- Often designed with **form** and function both in mind
- Collaborates with Industrial design to make something that is acceptable for the user

## Design Input

Initial design idea that proposes an idea to satisfy the user needs

## Design Process

Realizing the design input into a tangible product

### Implementation

- Be imaginative and creative
- Be Persistent
- Don't eliminate stupid ideas early
- Set boundaries

#### Brainstorming

##### Vertical / Convergent

- Eliminating stupid ideas
- Realigns designs to goals
- More rigid

##### Horizontal / Divergent

- Non-judgemental
- Creative
- Semi-random
- Generating any idea, even unrealistic at first

#### Concept Evaluation

Rates ideas by

- Meeting requirements
- Cost
- Time
- Which goals does it meet? Needs or wants?

#### Architecture and Systems level design

- Break down large problems into smaller problems once a main idea has been made
- Separates and specifies which parts are in which system or module
- 

## Design Output

The prototype that is ready for real-world testing

### Verification

Comparing the design back to the input to verify that it was build correctly

## Final Device

The final device that is ready to be used and sold in the real-world

### Validation

Checking whether the final device actually solves the user needs and meets requirements
