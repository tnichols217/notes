# What is Engineering Design

1. Process of creating a system, design, or part to meet needs
2. Mostly uses an iterative approach to apply knowledge to problems and needs

# Design Process

## User Needs

The needs or problem that needs to be solved.
Specifies the requirements of the process

- Categorizes requirements, wants, nice to haves
- Also specifies what is safe and possible

### Solving ambiguity
Ensure that all requirements are solidly defined and specified
Later in the process, 

## Design Input

Initial design idea that proposes an idea to satisfy the user needs

## Design Process

Realizing the design input into a tangible product

## Design Output

The prototype that is ready for real-world testing

### Verification

Comparing the design back to the input to verify that it was build correctly

## Final Device

The final device that is ready to be used and sold in the real-world

### Validation

Checking whether the final device actually solves the user needs and meets requirements
