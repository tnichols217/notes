# What is Engineering Design

1. Process of creating a system, design, or part to meet needs
2. Mostly uses an iterative approach to apply knowledge to problems and needs

# Design Process

The process that is followed in order to design a product that solves specifications

- **Ensure the entire process is documented** for testing, design, and brainstorming
- Records all decisions and rationale
- Communicate throughout the process
- Legal records of who did what

## User Needs

The needs or problem that needs to be solved
Specifies the requirements of the process

### Solving ambiguity

Ensure that all requirements are solidly defined and specified
Later in the process, having well defined ideas are useful for organization
Need to move from words to numbers to strongly specify requirements

### Implementation

#### Qualitative

- Strong
- fast
- accessible
- durable

#### Technical Specs (Quantitative)

- Holds 100kg
- Less than 5$
- Can be accelerated to 5g

#### Categories

- Needs (MUST have)
- Wants (SHOULD have)
- Gee Wiz (COULD have)
- Also specifies what is safe and possible

#### User Empathy

Understanding the user and what they want from a perspective of what is possible

#### Design

- Often designed with **form** and function both in mind
- Collaborates with Industrial design to make something that is acceptable for the user

## Design Input

Initial design idea that proposes an idea to satisfy the user needs

## Design Process

Realizing the design input into a tangible product

### Implementation

- Be imaginative and creative
- Be Persistent
- Don't eliminate stupid ideas early
- Set boundaries

#### Brainstorming

##### Vertical / Convergent

- Eliminating stupid ideas
- Realigns designs to goals
- More rigid

##### Horizontal / Divergent

- Non-judgemental
- Creative
- Semi-random
- Generating any idea, even unrealistic at first

#### Concept Evaluation

Rates ideas by

- Meeting requirements
- Cost
- Time
- Which goals does it meet? Needs or wants?

#### Architecture and Systems level design

- Break down large problems into smaller problems once a main idea has been made
- Separates and specifies which parts are in which system or module
- Begin sketching and create diagrams to organize

#### Detailed Design

- Parts
- Drawings
- Circuits
- Flowcharting
- Sources
- Documentation

## Design Output

The prototype that is ready for real-world testing

### Implementation

#### Prototype

- Completely remove ALL ambiguity and realize all plans
- Try it out to find out if it works or not
- Moves from theory into real world practice
- **Records and documents** all problems and solutions

#### Testing

Testing to see if the product works on multiple levels in order:

- Props
- Bench Testing
- Sim.
- Tissues
- Acute Animal
- Cadaver
- Chronic Animal
- Live Human

### Verification

Comparing the design back to the input to verify that it was build correctly
**Did you build it right/correctlty?**

- Testing against the technical specifications
- A series of detailed tests tat ensures all technically specified specifications are reliable, accurate, and correct

## Final Device

The final device that is ready to be used and sold in the real-world

### Validation

Checking whether the final device actually solves the user needs and meets requirements
**Did you build the right thing for the right problem?**

- Ensuring that the product actually solves problems
- Check whether you build the correct product

## Document Naming
