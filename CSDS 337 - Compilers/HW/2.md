# HW 2

## 3.3.2

Describe the languages denoted by the following regular expressions

### a

$a(a|b)*a$

> [!answer]
> "a" followed by any amount of "a"s or "b"s, then ending surely with an "a"

### b

$((\epsilon|a)b*)*$

> [!answer]
> A combination of "a"s and "b"s in any order or repetition. Could be completely empty.

### c

$(a|b)*a(a|b)(a|b)$

> [!answer]
> An "a" that is preceeded with any amounts of "a"s and "b"s, and followed by "a" or "b" and "a" or "b".

### d

$a*ba*ba*ba*$

> [!answer]
> A string of "a"s and "b"s where you can have any amount of "a"s (including 0), and must have exactly 3 "b"s dispersed among the string.

### e

$(aa|bb)*((ab|ba)(aa|bb)*(ab|ba)(aa|bb)*)*$

> [!answer]
> A string of "a"s and "b"s that has an even length, and any combination of "a"s or "b"s among it.

## 3.3.5

Write regular definitions for the following languages

### c

Comments, consisting of a string surrounded by `/*` and `*/`, without an intervening `*/`, unless it is inside double-quotes (`"`).

> [!answer]
> `(\/\*)(("[^"]*")*[^"^(\*\/)])*\*\/`

## 3.4.1

Provide transition diagrams to recognize the same languages as each of the regular expressions in Exercise 3.3.2.

### a

> [!answer]
> ![[2/tables#^a|tables]]

### b

> [!answer]
> ![[2/tables#^b|tables]]

### c

> [!answer]
> ![[2/tables#^c|tables]]

### d

> [!answer]
> ![[2/tables#^d|tables]]

## 3.4.2

Provide transition diagrams to recognize the same languages as each of the regular expressions in Exercise 3.3.5.

### c

> [!answer]
> ![[2/tables#^c2|tables]]

## 3.6.2

### c

> [!answer]
> An NFA for the graph given in the previous question would be as follows:
> 
> ![[2/tables#^362|tables]]

## 3.7.3

### a

$(a|b)*$

> [!answer]
> First, we utilize algorithm 3.23 to produce this graph:
> ![[2/tables#^b2|tables]]
> 
> From the graph, we get the following transition table:
> ![[2/tables#^b3|tables]]
> 
> Applying algorithm 3.20 provides us the following DFA table:
> ![[2/tables#^b4|tables]]
> 
> Providing just the transition table gives:
> ![[2/tables#^b5|tables]]
> 
> Finally, drawing the final diagram provides:
> ![[2/tables#^b6|tables]]

# Compiler

Information about our compiler may be found in the following GitHub repo:

[https://github.com/404Wolf/typescripten/](https://github.com/404Wolf/typescripten/)

Test runs for the textbook example produce the following result:

[https://github.com/404Wolf/typescripten/blob/main/textbook-run.ans](https://github.com/404Wolf/typescripten/blob/main/textbook-run.ans)

```
{ basic id ; basic id ; basic id ; basic id ; basic [ num ] id ; while ( true ) { do id = id + num ; while ( id [ id ] < id ) ; do id = id - num ; while ( id [ id ] > id ) ; if ( id >= id ) break ; id = id [ id ] ; id [ id ] = id [ id ] ; id [ id ] = id } }

Parsing completed successfully.
