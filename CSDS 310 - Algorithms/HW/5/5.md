There are $n$ basketball teams in the world. The ranking of these teams from the previous year is available. This year, some of these $n$ teams played against each other and the winner of each game was determined. There were $m$ games in total. The International Basketball Association wants to introduce a new performance criterion, called “domination factor”, defined as follows: Team $i$ is said to “dominate” team $j$ if we can find a chain of games such that $j$ was beaten by a team that was beaten by a team that was beaten by a team ... that was beaten by $i$ (observe that, according to this definition, domination can be bi-directional, i.e., $i$ and $j$ can dominate each other). Then, for each team $i$, the domination factor $z_{i}$ is defined as the rank of the best team (that is, the highest ranked team according to last year’s rankings) that is dominated by team $i$. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the domination factor for all the $n$ teams.

Prove or disprove the following statements:

### a

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph. For any $uv \in E$, if some run of Depth-First-Search (DFS) on $G$ results in $v.f > u.f$, then $uv$ must be on a cycle.

> [!answer]
> If for arbitrary nodes $v$ and $u$ with edge $uv$.
> For arbitrary DFS, either $u$ or $v$ could be discovered first.
> 
> If $u$ is discovered first, then $v$ will finish before $u$ as $v$ is a child of $u$.
> Therefore $u.f>v.f$.
> 
> If $v$ is discovered first, $v$ can either be an ancestor of $u$ or not.
> If $v$ is not an ancestor of $u$, then by the end of the traversal of $v$, $u$ will not be discovered, so it must be traversed later in DFS.
> Therefore $u.f>v.f$.
> 
> If $v$ is an ancestor of $u$, then $u$ must finish before $v$ by the structure of DFS.
> Therefore $v.f>u.f$.
> 
> By exhaustion, the only possible way to obtain $v.f>u.f$ with edge $uv$ in an arbitrary DFS is if $v$ is discovered before $u$ and $u$ must be an ancestor of $v$.
> 
> If $u$ is an ancestor of $v$ and edge $uv$ exists, then $u$ and $v$ must be on a loop.

### b

Consider any run of DFS on a directed graph $G = (V, E)$. For any edge $uv \in E$, if there is a path from $v$ to $u$ in $G$, then $uv$ cannot be a cross edge

> [!answer]
> Similar to the previous question, for arbitrary nodes $u$ and $v$ with edge $uv$ where $v$ is also an ancestor of $u$
> For arbitrary DFS, either $u$ or $v$ will be discovered first.
> 
> If $u$ is discovered first, then the edge $uv$ must be a tree edge or a forward edge, as we know $v$ must be in $u$'s tree and an ancestor of $u$.
> 
> If $v$ is discovered first, then since $u$ is a descendant of $v$, it must be part of $v$'s tree. Therefore, the edge $uv$ must be a back edge.
> 
> By exhaution, there are no possible ways for $uv$ to be a cross edge given that $uv$ exists and $u$ is also a descendent of $v$

There are two types of professional wrestlers: “babyfaces” (“good guys”) and “heels” (“bad guys”). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have $n$ professional wrestlers and we have a list of $r$ pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an efficient algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a babyface and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should produce it

> [!answer]
> Where we modify BFS to instead return the depth of all nodes, and a list of all edges not in the BFS tree.
