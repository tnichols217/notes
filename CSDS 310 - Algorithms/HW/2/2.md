CSDS 310: Algorithms

## 1

For each of the following pairs of functions, write down the asymptotic relation between $f(n)$ and $g(n)$; i.e., if $f(n) \in x(g(n))$ where $x\in\{o, \theta, \omega, O, \Omega\}$. Assume that $k \ge 0, \epsilon > 0, c > 1$. Provide a justification for your answers.  

### a

$f(n)=\log^{k}n\quad g(n)=n^\epsilon$


### b

$f(n)=n^{k\quad}g(n)=c^n$

### c

$f(n)=\sqrt n\quad g(n)=n^{\sin n}$

## 2

Considering functions $f(n) \ge 0, g(n) \ge 0, c > 0$, indicate whether each of the following statements is true. Prove the statements that are true by providing a formal argument that is based on the definition of asymptotic notation. For statements that are false, provide a counter-example to prove that they are false.  

### a

$f(n) \ge 1\to f(n)+c \in O(f(n))$

### b

$f(2n) \in \theta(f(n))$

### c

$f(n)\in O(nc)\to f(2n)\in O(nc)$

## 3

Let $0 < \lambda < 1 < a < b$ be constants. Solve the following recurrences using Master Method, noting the case that applies.

### a

$T(n) = bT(n/a) + \theta(n)$  

### b

$T(n) = a2T(n/a) + \theta(n2)$

### c

$T(n) = T(\lambda n) + n\lambda$

## 4

You are given an array of $k$ sorted arrays each of which has a length $n/k$ elements. Describe an efficient algorithm to merge these arrays to obtain one sorted array of length $n$.
