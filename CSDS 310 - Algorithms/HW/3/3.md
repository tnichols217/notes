## 1

We are given $n$ types of coin denominations with integer values $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}$. Given an integer $t$, we would like to compute the minimum number of coins to make change for $t$. We know that one of the coins has value 1, so we can always make change for any amount of money $t$.

For example, if we have coin denominations of $1$, $2$, and $5$, then the optimal solution for $t = 9$ is $5, 2, 2$.

> The auxilary loop takes $\theta(n)$ time to execute. This loop must only execute for non-memoed amounts. We may maximally run the loop $a$ times for the amount of value we are looking for.

## 2

Given two strings $X = < x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{m} >$ and $Y = < y_{1}, y_{2}, \dots, y_{n} >$, the edit distance between $X$ and $Y$ is defined as the minimum number of edit operations (replacement, insertion, or deletion of a character) required to convert $X$ to $Y$.

For example, the edit distance between $X = \text{esteban}$ and $Y = \text{stephen}$ is $4$, comprising of 1 deletion $(e)$, 1 insertion $(h)$, and 2 replacements ($b \to p$ and $a \to e$). We would like to compute the edit distance between two given strings.

## 3

We are given $n$ currencies and an exchange rate $r_{ij}$ for any pair of currencies $i$ and $j$. Namely, if we exchange $1$ unit of currency $i$ with currency $j$, we receive $r_{ij}$ units of currency $j$. If we are given a source currency $s$ and a target currency $t$, then we can go through a path of different currencies to reach $t$ from $s$ so as to maximize our profit. The markets can also charge an exchange fee depending on the number of exchanges we make. For example if the exchange fee is $f(k)$ for making $k$ exchanges and we start with 1 unit of currency $s$, then the path of exchanges $s \to t$  will yield $r_{st} - f(1)$ units of currency $t$, whereas the path of exchanges $s \to i \to j \to t$ will yield $r_{si} \times r_{ij} \times r_{jt} - f(3)$ units of currency $t$. The problem is to find the sequence of exchanges that will maximize the amount of target currency $t$ we can obtain for a given source currency $s$.

> We cannot assume much about the problem as not much was explicitly given to us for this problem.
> For one, we do not know about the structure of our cost function $f$ at all, not even if it is strictly increasing or not. For the sake of now knowing, we make no assumptions about $f$ in my implementation.
> For two, we cannot know for sure if there are indefinite loops possible within our conversion matrix $r$ where infinite money is allowed to be made, since we also do not know if the cost function $f$ is positive or non-zero at all, thus we must implement a depth limit to prevent an infinite recursion from occurring.
> Lastly, we cannot assume is loops are permitted at all, but their disallowance would break the issue of optimal substructure, so we assume that they are allowed.
