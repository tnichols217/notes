## 1

We started activity selection problem in class. Prove that the following greedy choices do not lead to optimal solutions for the activity selection problem:

### a

Select the activity with the earliest starting time.

> [!answer]
> Counterexample:
> $[[1,15],[2,3],[4,5],[6,7]]$
> 
> This would choose $[1,15]$, which is one activity, while clearly the optimum is the other three.

### b

Select the activity with least duration.

> [!answer]
> Counterexample:
> $[[0,10],[9,11],[10,20],[19,21],[20,30]]$
> 
> This would choose $[[9,11],[19,21]]$ when the optimal is the other three (longer) activities.

### c

Select the activity that overlaps the fewest other remaining activities

> [!answer]
> Counterexample:
> $[[0,10],[9,11],[9,11],[9,11],[10,20],[10,20],[10,20],[19,21],[19,21],[19,21],[20,30]]$
> 
> Number of overlaps:
> $[3,6,6,6,7,7,7,6,6,6,3]$
> 
> This strategy would pick one of the $[9,11]$ and one of the $[19,21]$, which is less optimal than selecting the three other activities.

You are given two sets $A$ and $B$, each containing $n$ positive integers. You can choose to reorder each set however you like. After reordering let $a_{i}$ be the $i$th element of set $A$ and $b_{i}$ the $i$th element of set $B$. You then receive a payout of $\prod\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}^{b_{i}}$.

Give an algorithm that maximizes your profit.

> [!answer]
> It is evident that we would like as many multiples of larger numbers as possible, as all values in $A$ will be producted in the end anyway.
> 
> We should sort $A$ and $B$ in both either increasing order or decreasing order, as long as $A$ and $B$ are in the same order.

## 3

We have $n$ activities. Each activity requires $t_{i}$ time to complete and has deadline $d_{i}$. We would like to schedule the activities to minimize the maximum delay in completing any activity; that is, we would like to assign starting times $s_{i}$ to all activities so that $\max_{1\le i\le n}{\Delta_{i}}$ is minimized, where $\Delta_{i} = f_{i} - d_{i}$ is the delay for activity $i$ and $f_{i} = s_{i} + t_{i}$ is the finishing time for activity $i$. Note that we can only perform one activity at a given time (if activity $i$ starts at time $s_{i}$, the next scheduled activity has to start at time $f_{i}$).

For example, if $t =\langle 10, 5, 6, 2 \rangle$ and $d =\langle 11, 6, 12, 20 \rangle$, then the optimal solution is to schedule the activities in the order $\langle 2, 1, 3, 4 \rangle$ to obtain starting/finishing times $s/f =\langle  5/15, 0/5, 15/21, 21/23 \rangle$ and achieve a maximum delay of $9$ (for the third activity).

Give an algorithm that minimizes the maximum delay.

> [!answer]
> The next activity we choose to do will be the one that has the soonest deadline. Essentially, we will sort the indices of the deadline array by the values of the deadlines. These will be the order of the indices that we will perform the tasks in.

## 4

We have infinite supply of integer coin denominations of $c_{1} = 1 < c_{2} < \dots < c_{k}$ to make change for a given an integer amount $n$. For this purpose, we would like to find the minimum number of coins that add up to $n$. An obvious greedy choice for this problem is to use the largest coin that has value less than or equal to $n$ (e.g., if $c_{k} \le n$, then return $c_{k}$, and solve the problem for $n - c_{k}$).

### a

Prove that, if the coin denominations are arbitrary, this greedy choice is not guaranteed to lead to an optimal solution. (Just prove the greedy choice, no pseudocode or run time)

> [!answer]
> Counterexample:
> $n=10$
> $c=[1,5,8]$
> 
> Using the largest possible coin possible, we are left with the solution of $[8,1,1]$ of $3$ coins.
> 
> This is clearly not optimal as we are able to represent $10$ as $[5,5]$, with $2$ coins.

### b

Prove that, if the coin denominations are powers of $2$, i.e., $c_{i} = 2^{i-1}: 1 \le i \le k$, then this greedy choice is guaranteed to lead to an optimal solution. (Just prove the greedy choice, no pseudocode or run time)

> [!answer]
> This is equivalent to the binary counting problem.
> 
> I assert that given any target amount $n$, the largest possible coin that is less than $n$ must be part of the solution $S$ for the minimal number of coins to represent $n$.
> 
> Assume that this statement is not true.
> 
> If the largest coin is $c_k$, where $c_{k}\le n$, $c_{k}$ is not part of $S$.
> 
> By the definition of the available coins, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}c_{i}=c_{k}-1=c_{k}'$
> Thus, $c_{k}'<n$.
> 
> $c_{k}'$ is the maximum possible amount possible without repeating coins and without using the max coin $c_{k}$. Since $c_{k}'<n$, we know that at least one coin has to be repeated if $c_{k}$ is not part of the solution.
> 
> For any coin $c_{j}$ that is repeated, we are able to construct $S'$ where the number of coins is one less, where we remove two $c_{j}$ and add one $c_{j+1}$, as $2c_{j}=c_{j+1}$. Thus $S'=S-1$ and so $S$ cannot be an optimal solution.
> 
> Now, say $S_{j}'$ is $S$ with all possible $c_{j}$ coins merged into $c_{j+1}$ coins and all smaller coins merged upwards as well. We know there will be no repeats of coins smaller than $c_{j+1}$. Let $c_{j}''=\sum\limits_{i=j}^{k-1}a_{i}c_{i}$ with these coins merged where $a_{i}$ is the amount of coins present for that coin type. Also let $c_{j}'''=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{j-1}p_{i}c_{i}$ where $p_{i}$ is whether the coin $c_{i}$ is present when all coins below $c_{j}$ have been merged.
> 
> $c_{j}''+c_{j}'''=n>c_{k}'$
> 
> As $j\to k-1$, $c_{k-1}''+c_{k-1}'''>c_{k}'$,
> We know $c_{k-1}'''<c_{k-1}'<n$ by their definitions. Thus $c_{k-1}''>n-c_{k-1}'$.
> 
> However, since $n>c_{k}'$, $n-c_{k-1}'>c_{k-1}$
> $\implies c_{k-1}''>c_{k-1}$
> Since $c_{k}''$ is a sum of only $c_k$, we must merge at least two $c_{k-1}$ coins into a $c_{k}$ coin.
> 
> As such, a solution containing $c_{k}$ must always be more optimal than a solution not containing it. Thus our greedy solution picking $c_{k}$ is correct.
