> The Voyage of the Dawn Trader by C.S. Lewis in his Chronicles of Narnia series utilizes a strong Christian Lift extended metaphor to convey the sense of the journey of a Christian life as they characters in the story undergo a physical journey themselves filled with adventure and turmoil.

> The book covers utilizes multiple ideas and sub-stories to aide the main story-line as a whole. The main idea of the entire story is the quest to reach Aslan's Country. This represents our journey in Christianity as a whole, the journey to getting closer to his country as a reference to our journey on the way to getting closer with God. This is the main theme of the story, as all other plots are just detours on the way up. This stood out to me because it was the main idea of the story and it is kinda hard to miss, yet incomparably important for understanding the story as a whole. Next, there is the Island of the Dufflepuds: an interesting encounter with strange creatures as they trek on. This section of the story is an example of the distractions of life and how they may push us off the track to God. This stood out to me plainly because of how creatively C.S. Lewis portrays these problems and how easy they are to relate to our own life. Lastly, are the last words of Ramandu.
