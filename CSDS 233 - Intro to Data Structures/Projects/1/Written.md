Find tightest O(f(n)) for each of the following functions: The tightest big-O bound is the narrowest upper bound within the big-O category.

Example: n = O(n ), n = O(n ).. and so on, but the tightest bound would be n = O(n)

Show you work by using the definition of big-O and finding values for c and N.
Reminder f(n) is O(g(n)) — if a positive real number c and positive integer N exist such that f(n)
≤ c × g(n) for all n ≥ N
