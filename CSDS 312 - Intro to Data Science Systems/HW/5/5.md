Compare the performance with sse2 and avx2 extensions in regards to “vectMul.c” at ~/csds312/simd (i.e. sse2 vs avx2)

```bash
[tln32@class-login2 ~]$ cd ~/csds312/simd
[tln32@class-login2 simd]$ srun -A csds312 -p markov_cpu --pty /bin/bash
[tln32@classct005 simd]$ module load iccifort
[tln32@classct005 simd]$ icc -o novect -O0 vectMul.c -lm

This gives us the result of:

Report GPU utilization - [https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/guides-and-training/helpful-references/hpc-environment/gpu-benchmark--hpc](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/guides-and-training/helpful-references/hpc-environment/gpu-benchmark--hpc). (use 2 Gpus to avoid conflict at /tmp/GPUBenchReport though only one GPU is utilized)

```bash
[tln32@class-login2 ~]$ cd ~/csds312
[tln32@class-login2 ~]$ cp -r /usr/local/doc/MATLAB/GPUBench-v2p1 .
[tln32@class-login2]~/csds312% cd GPUBench-v2p1/

### GPU Comparison Report

#### Summary of results

The table and chart below show the peak performance of various GPUs using the same version of MATLAB. Your results (if any) are highlighted in bold in the table and on the chart. All other results are from pre-stored data. The peak performance shown is usually achieved when dealing with extremely large arrays. Typical performance in day-to-day use will usually be much lower.

Results captured using the CPUs on the host PC (i.e., without using a GPU) are included for comparison.

Results are shown for calculations in both single and double precision. For all results, higher is better.
