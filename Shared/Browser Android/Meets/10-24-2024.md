# Meeting To-Dos

## Logistical
- Create timeline
- Think about market research
	- How we want to figure out what people want
	- Create a comprehensive list of what is out there already
- Create Google sheet and do some price analysis
	- Figure out how we will run everything and do price calculations to figure out where and how much it will cost to host and how much we can offer it for
- Outreach to TT (android guy at google)	

## Technical
- Schemas
- Nix build inputs
- Make the system diagram non phone specific
- Longer term ideas for expansion

## Tasks to Delegate 
- Find another person interested in helping us

Urgent
- Name the project

What MIGHT people want?
- Android and mobile emulators (e.g. watchos too)
	- IOS apple emulators
- Desktop emulators (that stream to browsers)

How will we figure out if that is what they want?
