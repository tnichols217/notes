A department wants to schedule final exams so that no student has more than one exam on any given day. The vertices of the graph below show the courses that are being taken by more than one student, with an edge connecting two vertices if there is a student in both courses. Find a way to color the vertices of the graph with only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color and explain how to use the result to schedule the final exams.

```dot
graph{
	MCS101--{MCS100 MCS135 MCS130 MCS120}
	MCS100--{MCS110 MCS135}
}
```
