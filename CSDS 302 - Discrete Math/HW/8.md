## 4

In a group of $700$ people, must there be $2$ who have the same first and last initials? Why?

> [!answer]
> Yes, if there are $26$ letters, there are $26^2$ combinations of two letters.
> 
> $26^2<700$ so there must at least be two with the same initials in a group of $700$ people due to the pigeonhole principle.

## 7

Let $S=\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}$. Suppose six integers are chosen from $S$. Must there be two integers whose sum is $15$? Why?

> [!answer]
> Yes, if we separate the original set into multiple sets with sums of 15, there would be 5 sets of sums of 15. Since we are choosing 6 integers, and there are only 5 sets, one set must have both integers selected. Therefore, there must be a sum of 15 at least once.

## 11

If $n+1$ integers are chosen from the set $\{1, 2, 3,..., 2n\}$, where $n$ is a positive integer, must at least one of them be even? Why?

> [!answer]
> In that set, there are only $n$ odd numbers, we are choosing more then $n$ integers from the list, so at least one integer must be non-odd (or even) by the pigeonhole principle.

## 31

A group of $15$ executives are to share $5$ assistants. Each executive is assigned exactly $1$ assistant, and no assistant is assigned to more than $4$ executives. Show that at least $3$ assistants are assigned to $3$ or more executives.

> [!answer]
> If the assistants were evenly distributed across all executives, then there would be 5 assistants with 3 executives, if they were as unevenly distributed as possible, then there would be 3 assistants with 4 executives and 1 assistant with 2 executives and 1 assistant with 1 executive. By our upper and lower bounds, there must always be at least 3 assistants assigned to 3 or more executives.

## 33

Let $A$ be a set of six positive integers each of which is less than $15$. Show that there must be two distinct subsets of $A$ whose elements when added up give the same sum. (Thanks to Jonathan Goldstine for this problem.)

> [!answer]
> In a set of six integers below 15, the maximum variance of the sum of any subset with one or more elements will be equivalent to the sum of the 5 highest possible integers, which in this case is $60$. Including the $1$ possibility that the subset has $0$ size, there are at most $61$ possible sums of a subset of 6 integers below 15. Since there are $2^6=64$ possible subsets of a set of 6, there must be some subsets that have the same sum by the GPP.

Imagine there is a drug test that is 98% accurate, meaning that 98% of the time, it shows a true positive result for someone using the drug, and 98% of the time, it shows a true negative result for nonusers of the drug. Next, assume 0.5% of people use the drug. If a person selected at random tests positive for the drug, what is the probability the person is actually a user of the drug?

> [!answer]
> This definition of test accuracy is inaccurate. An accuracy of 98% only means it is correct 98% of the time overall, not that it "shows a true positive result for someone using the drug, and 98% of the time, it shows a true negative result for nonusers of the drug". The two individual accuracies need not be equal. I will use this incorrect definition of the term for this question as it is unsolvable otherwise.
