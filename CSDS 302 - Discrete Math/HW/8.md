**(8 points)** One blue die and one gray die are rolled, what is the probability that the sum of the numbers is 6, given that both of the numbers are odd?

## 2

**(8 points)** Imagine there is a drug test that is 98% accurate, meaning that 98% of the time, it shows a true positive result for someone using the drug, and 98% of the time, it shows a true negative result for nonusers of the drug. Next, assume 0.5% of people use the drug. If a person selected at random tests positive for the drug, what is the probability the person is actually a user of the drug?
