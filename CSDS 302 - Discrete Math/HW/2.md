# 2.1

## 2

Represent the common form of each argument using letters to stand for component sentences, and fill in the blanks so that the argument in part (b) has the same logical form as the argument in part (a).

### a

If all computer programs contain errors, then this program contains an error. This program does not contain an error. Therefore, it is not the case that all computer programs contain errors.

> [!answer]
> Let $A$ be the set of all computer programs,
> $E(x)$ be the argument "$x$ contains an error":
> 
> $\forall a\in A:E(a)\implies a:E(a)$
> $\exists a\in A:\lnot E(a)$
> $\therefore \lnot(\forall a\in A:E(a))$

### b

If \_\_\_\_ then \_\_\_\_. 2 is not odd. Therefore, it is not the case that all prime numbers are odd.

> [!answer]
> If all prime numbers are odd then 2 is odd. 2 is not odd. Therefore, it is not the case that all prime numbers are odd.

## 5

Indicate which of the following sentences are statements.

### b

> [!answer]
> Yes, they are logically equivalent by definition of tautology
> 
> ![[Tables#^19]]
> 
> Yes, by the definition of a tautology, these are equivalent, which is supported by the table

### 20

$p\land\mathbf c$ and $p\lor\mathbf c$

> [!answer]
> No, they are not logically equivalent
> 
> ![[Tables#^20]]
> 
> The definition of a contradiction states that the second statement will be equivalent to just $p$ while the definition of and will make the first statement also a contraction. Which are not equivalent to each other

### 22

$p\land(q\lor r)$ and $(p\land q)\lor(p\land r)$

> [!answer]
> Yes, this is equivalent according to the distributive law.
> 
> ![[Tables#^22]]

### 24

$(p\lor q)\lor(p\land r)$ and $(p\lor q)\land r$

> [!answer]
> No, these are not equivalent.
> 
> ![[Tables#^24]]
> 
> The first statement can be reorganized to
> 
> $q\lor (p\lor(p\land r))$
> $q\lor p$ (Absorbtion)
> Let $s=q\lor p$
> $s\not\equiv s\land r$

## 35

Assume x is a particular real number and use De Morgan’s laws to write negations for the statement
$x\le-1$ or $x>1$

> [!answer]
> $x>-1$ and $x\le 1$

## 43

Use a truth table to establish if the statement form is a tautology or if it is a contradiction.

$(\sim p\lor q)\lor (p\land\sim q)$

> [!answer]
> ![[Tables#^43]]
> 
> This is a tautology as it is always true.

## 49

A logical equivalence is derived from Theorem 2.1.1. Supply a reason for each step.

$(p\lor\sim q)\land(\sim p\lor\sim q)$
$\qquad \equiv(\sim q\lor p)\land(\sim q\lor\sim p)$
$\qquad \equiv\sim q\lor(p\land\sim p)$
$\qquad \equiv\sim q\lor\mathbf c$
$\qquad \equiv\sim q$
Therefore, $(p\lor\sim q)\land(\sim p\lor\sim q)\equiv \sim q$

> [!answer]
> $(p\lor\sim q)\land(\sim p\lor\sim q)$
> $\qquad \equiv(\sim q\lor p)\land(\sim q\lor\sim p)$ Communicative
> $\qquad \equiv\sim q\lor(p\land\sim p)$ DIstributive
> $\qquad \equiv\sim q\lor\mathbf c$ Negation
> $\qquad \equiv\sim q$  Identity
> Therefore, $(p\lor\sim q)\land(\sim p\lor\sim q)\equiv \sim q$

## 51

Use Theorem 2.1.1 to verify the logical equivalence. Supply a reason for each step.

$p\land(\sim q\lor p)\equiv p$

Use truth tables to establish the truth of this statement

The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent to each other.

> [!answer]
> ![[Tables#^27]]
> 
> The columns for the inverse and the converse in the table above are exactly the same, meaning they are logically equivalent.

## 30

If statement forms $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent, then $P\leftrightarrow Q$ is a tautology. Conversely, if $P\leftrightarrow Q$ is a tautology, then $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent. Use $\leftrightarrow$ to convert the logical equivalence to a tautology. Then use a truth table to verify each tautology.

$p\land (q\lor r)\equiv (p\land q)\lor(p\land r)$

> [!answer]
> $p\land (q\lor r)\leftrightarrow (p\land q)\lor(p\land r)$

# 2.3

## 4

Use modus ponens or modus tollens to fill in the blanks in the argument so as to produce valid inferences.

If this graph can be colored with three colors, then it can colored with four colors. This graph cannot be colored with four colors.

> [!answer]
> If this graph can be colored with three colors, then it can colored with four colors.
> This graph cannot be colored with four colors.
> Therefore, this graph cannot be colored with three colors.

## 9

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument form is valid. Indicate which columns represent the premises and which represent the conclusion, and include a sentence explaining how the truth table supports your answer. Your explanation should show that you understand what it means for a form of argument to be valid or invalid.

$p\land q\to \sim r$
$p\lor \sim q$
$\sim q\to p$
$\therefore \sim r$

> [!answer]
> ![[Tables#^9]]
> 
> As you can see in the table, I have italicized or bolded the rows where all the premises are true. The first and third line both have true conditions, but the middle one is false, which means that given the necessary premises, we cannot guarantee the conclusion. Therefore this argument is false.

## 23

Use symbols to write the logical form of each argument, and then use a truth table to test the argument for validity. Indicate which columns represent the premises and which represent the conclusion, and include a few words of explanation showing that you understand the meaning of validity.

Oleg is a math major or Oleg is an economics major.
If Oleg is a math major, then Oleg is required to take Math 362.
$\therefore$ Oleg is an economics major or Oleg is not required to take Math 362.

> [!answer]
> Let:
> $p=$"Oleg is a math major"
> $q=$"Oleg is an economics major"
> $r=$"Oleg is required to take Math 362"
> $p\lor q$
> $p\to r$
> $\therefore q\lor r$
> 
> ![[Tables#^23]]
> 
> As you can see in the table, when all the premises are true (bolded in yellow), the conclusion is also always true.

## 29-32

Some of the arguments in 29–32 are valid, whereas others exhibit the converse or the inverse error. Use symbols to write the logical form of each argument. If the argument is valid, identify the rule of inference that guarantees its validity. Otherwise, state whether the converse or the inverse error is made.

### 29

If at least one of these two numbers is divisible by 6, then the product of these two numbers is divisible by 6.
Neither of these two numbers is divisible by 6.
$\therefore$ The product of these two numbers is not divisible by 6.

> [!answer]
> Let:
> $p=$"At least one of these two numbers is divisible by 6"
> $q=$"The product of these two numbers is divisible by 6"
> $p\to q$
> $\lnot p$
> $\therefore\lnot q$
> 
> False, as this is an inverse error.
> $p\to q$
> $\equiv\lnot p\lor q$
> Given $\lnot p$
> $\equiv\mathbf t q$



### 32

If I get a Christmas bonus, I’ll buy a stereo.
If I sell my motorcycle, I’ll buy a stereo.
$\therefore$ If I get a Christmas bonus or I sell my motorcycle, then I’ll buy a stereo.

## 40

Sharky, a leader of the underworld, was killed by one of his own band of four henchmen. Detective Sharp interviewed the men and determined that all were lying except for one. He deduced who killed Sharky on the basis of the following statements:

1. Socko: Lefty killed Sharky.
2. Fats: Muscles didn’t kill Sharky.
3. Lefty: Muscles was shooting craps with Socko when Sharky was knocked off.
4. Muscles: Lefty didn’t kill Sharky.

Who did kill Sharky?

> [!answer]
> Muscles must've killed Sharky as all the statements would be false except Muscle's own statement that Lefty didn't kill Sharky

## 44

A set of premises and a conclusion are given. Use the valid argument forms listed in Table 2.3.1 to deduce the conclusion from the premises, giving a reason for each step as in Example 2.3.8. Assume all variables are statement variables.

1. $p\to q$
2. $r\lor s$
3. $\sim s\to\sim t$
4. $\sim q\lor s$
5. $\sim s$
6. $\sim q\land r\to u$
7. $w\lor t$
8. $\therefore u\land w$
