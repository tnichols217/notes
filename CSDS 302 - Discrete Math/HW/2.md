Represent the common form of each argument using letters to stand for component sentences, and fill in the blanks so that the argument in part (b) has the same logical form as the argument in part (a).

### a

If all computer programs contain errors, then this program contains an error. This program does not contain an error. Therefore, it is not the case that all computer programs contain errors.

### b

If \_\_\_\_ then \_\_\_\_. 2 is not odd. Therefore, it is not the case that all prime numbers are odd.

## 5

Indicate which of the following sentences are statements.

### b

She is a mathematics major.

### c

$128=2^6$

## 8

Write the statements in symbolic form using the symbols $\sim,\land,\lor$ and the indicated letters to represent component statements.

Let $h=$“John is healthy,” $w=$“John is wealthy,” and $s=“John is wise.”

### b

John is not wealthy but he is healthy and wise.

### e

John is wealthy, but he is not both healthy and wise.

## 10

Let $p$ be the statement “DATAENDFLAG is off,” $q$ the statement “ERROR equals 0,” and $r$ the statement “SUM is less than 1,000.” Express the following sentences in symbolic notation.

### b

DATAENDFLAG is off but ERROR is not equal to 0.

### e

Either DATAENDFLAG is on or it is the case that both ERROR equals 0 and SUM is less than 1,000.

## 15

Write truth tables for the statement $p\land(\sim q\lor r)$

## 19

Determine whether the statement is logically equivalent. Construct a truth table and include a sentence justifying your answer. Your sentence should show that you understand the meaning of logical equivalence.
