If today is Tuesday, what day of the week will it be 1,000 days from today?

## 21

Suppose $b$ is any integer. If $b\mod12=5$, what is $8b \mod 12$? In other words, if division of $b$ by $12$ gives a remainder of $5$, what is the remainder when $8b$ is divided by $12$? Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

## 24

Prove that for all integers $m$ and $n$, if $m \mod 5=2$ and $n \mod 5=1$ then $mn \mod 5=2$.

## 38

Prove the statement

For every integer $m$, $m^2=5k$, or $m^2=5k+1$, or $m^2=5k+4$ for some integer $k$.

## 7

If $k$ is an integer, what is $\left\lfloor k+ \frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$? Why?

## 19-20

Some of the statements in 19-20 are true and some are
false. Prove each true statement and find a counterexample for each false statement, but do not use theorem 4.6.1 in your proofs.

### 19

For every real number $x$, $\left\lceil x-1\right\rceil=\lceil x\rceil-1$

### 20

For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, $\lceil xy\rceil=\lceil x\rceil\cdot\lceil y\rceil$

## 4

Use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer $m$, $7m+4$ is not divisible by $7$.
