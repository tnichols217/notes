If today is Tuesday, what day of the week will it be 1,000 days from today?

> [!answer]
> If the zeroth day of the week is Saturday, Tuesday will be the 3rd day of the week
> 
> Since the day of week is cyclical every 7 days, we can use $\mod 7$
> 
> $3+1000\mod 7=2$

## 21

Suppose $b$ is any integer. If $b\mod12=5$, what is $8b \mod 12$? In other words, if division of $b$ by $12$ gives a remainder of $5$, what is the remainder when $8b$ is divided by $12$? Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

## 24

Prove that for all integers $m$ and $n$, if $m \mod 5=2$ and $n \mod 5=1$ then $mn \mod 5=2$.

## 38

Prove the statement

For every integer $m$, $m^2=5k$, or $m^2=5k+1$, or $m^2=5k+4$ for some integer $k$.

# 4.6

## 7

If $k$ is an integer, what is $\left\lfloor k+ \frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$? Why?

## 19-20

Some of the statements in 19-20 are true and some are
false. Prove each true statement and find a counterexample for each false statement, but do not use theorem 4.6.1 in your proofs.

### 19

For every real number $x$, $\left\lceil x-1\right\rceil=\lceil x\rceil-1$

### 20

For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, $\lceil xy\rceil=\lceil x\rceil\cdot\lceil y\rceil$

# 4.7

## 4

Use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer $m$, $7m+4$ is not divisible by $7$.

## 6

Carefully formulate the negations of the statement. Then prove it by contradiction.

There is no greatest negative real number.

## 17

Prove the statement by contradiction

For all prime numbers $a,b,c$, $a^2+b^2\ne c^2$

# 4.8

## 14

Determine whether the statement is true or false. Prove it if it is true and disprove it if it is false.

The sum of any two positive irrational numbers is irrational.

## 23

Prove that for any integer $a$, $9 \nmid(a^2-3)$.

# 4.10

## 15-16

Use the euclidean algorithm to hand-calculate the greatest common divisors of each of the pairs of integers in 15â€“16.

### 15

$832$ and $10933$

### 16

$4131$ and $2431$

# 5.1

## 6

Write the first four terms of the sequence

$f_n=\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4}\right\rfloor\cdot 4$ for every integer $n\ge 1$

## 60

Rewrite as a single summation or product

$2\cdot\sum\limits_{k=1}^n(3k^2+4)+5\cdot\sum\limits_{k=1}^n(2k^2-1)$
