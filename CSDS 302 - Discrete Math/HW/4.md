# 4.2

## 13

Prove that the statement is false

There exists an integer $n$ such that $6n^2+27$ is prime.

## 27

Determine whether the statement is true or false. Justify your answer with a proof or a counterexample, as appropriate. In each case use only the definitions of the terms and the assumptions listed on page 161, not any previously established properties.

The difference of any two odd integers is even.

# 4.3

## 2-7

The numbers in 2–7 are rational. Write each number as a ratio of two integers.

### 2

$4.6037$

### 7

$52.4\overline{6721}$

# 4.4

## 5

Give a reason for your answer in each of 1–13. assume that all variables represent integers.

Is $6m(2m+10)$ divisible by $4$?

## 16

Prove the statement directly from the definition of divisibility.

For all integers $a,b,c$ if $a|b$ then $a|c$ then $a|(b+c)$.

## 21

For the statement, determine whether the statement is true or false. Prove the statement directly from the definitions if it is true, and give a counterexample if it is false.

The product of any two even integers is a multiple of $4$.

## 35

Two athletes run a circular track at a steady pace so that the first completes one round in 8 minutes and the second in 10 minutes. If they both start from the same spot at 4 p.m., when will be the first time they return to the start together?
