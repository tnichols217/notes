Rewrite the following statement informally in at least two different ways without using variables or the symbol $\forall$ or the words “for all.”

$\forall$ real numbers $x$, if $x$ is positive then the square root of $x$ is positive.

> - If $x$ is real and positive, then its square root is positive
> - If $x$ is positive and its square root is not positive, then $x$ is not a real number

## 28

Rewrite each statement without using quantifiers or variables. Indicate which are true and which are false, and justify your answers as best as you can.

Let the domain of $x$ be the set $D$ of objects discussed in mathematics courses, and let $\text{Real}(x)$ be “$x$ is a real number,” $\text{Pos}(x)$ be “$x$ is a positive real number,” $\text{Neg}(x)$ be “$x$ is a negative real number,” and $\text{Int}(x)$ be “$x$ is an integer.”

2. All discrete mathematics students are nonathletic.
3. There is an athletic person who is not a discrete mathematics student.
4. No discrete mathematics students are athletic.
5. Some discrete mathematics students are nonathletic.
6. No athletic people are discrete mathematics students.

## 5

Write a negation for each of the following statements.

### a

Every valid argument has a true conclusion.

### b

All real numbers are positive, negative, or zero.

## 12

Determine whether the proposed negation is correct. If it is not, write a correct negation.

*Statement*: The product of any irrational number and any rational number is irrational.

*Proposed negation*: The product of any irrational number and any rational number is rational.

## 17

Write a negation for each statement

$\forall$ integers $d$, if $\frac{6}{d}$ is an integer, then $d=3$

## 29

Write the contrapositive, converse, and inverse. Indicate as best as you can which of these statements are true and which are false. Give a counterexample for each that is false.

$\forall n\in Z$, if $n$ is prime then $n$ is odd or $n=2$.

## 48

Use the facts that the negation of a $\forall$ statement is a $\exists$ statement and that the negation of an if-then statement is an and statement to rewrite the statement without using the word necessary or sufficient.

Being a polynomial is not a sufficient condition for a function to have a real root.

# 3.3

## 19

Rewrite the statement in English without using the symbol $\forall$ or $\exists$ or variables and expressing your answer as simply as possible. Also, write a negation for the statement.

$\exists x\in\mathbf R$ such that for every real number $y$,
$x+y=0$

## 23

Rewrite the statement in English without using the symbol $\forall$ or $\exists$ or variables. Also, indicate whether the statement is true or false.

### a

# 3.4

## 2

Use universal instantiation or universal modus ponens to
fill in valid conclusions for the argument

If an integer $n$ equals $2k$ and $k$ is an integer, then $n$ is even.
$0$ equals $2\times0$ and $0$ is an integer.

## 14

The argument may be valid by universal modus ponens or universal modus tollens; others are invalid and exhibit the converse or the inverse error. State whether the argument is valid or invalid. Justify your answer.

If compilation of a computer program produces error messages, then the program is not correct.
Compilation of this program does not produce error messages.
$\therefore$ This program is correct.

## 22-24

Indicate whether the arguments in 22–24 are valid or
invalid. Support your answers by drawing diagrams.

### 22

All discrete mathematics students can tell a valid argument from an invalid one.
All thoughtful people can tell a valid argument from an invalid one.
$\therefore$ All discrete mathematics students are thoughtful.

### 24

No vegetarians eat meat.
All vegans are vegetarian.
$\therefore$ No vegans eat meat.
