# 3.1

Note: For Section 3.1, problems 4ab and 7cd. These problems are different between the 4th edition and the 5th edition. This time, please use the problems from the 4th edition. I also take a picture of these three problems in the 4th edition. So if you do not have the 4th edition, you can use this photo. But our lecture will still use the content of the 5th edition.
