# 3.1

Note: For Section 3.1, problems 4ab and 7cd. These problems are different between the 4th edition and the 5th edition. This time, please use the problems from the 4th edition. I also take a picture of these three problems in the 4th edition. So if you do not have the 4th edition, you can use this photo. But our lecture will still use the content of the 5th edition.

## 12

Find counterexamples to show that the statement is false

$\forall$ real numbers $x$ and $y$, $\sqrt{x+y}=\sqrt x+\sqrt y$.

## 17

Rewrite the following in the form “$\exists$ \_\_\_\_ $x$ such that \_\_\_\_.”

### b

Some real numbers are rational.

## 20

Rewrite the following statement informally in at least two different ways without using variables or the symbol $\forall$ or the words “for all.”

$\forall$ real numbers $x$, if $x$ is positive then the square root of $x$ is positive.

## 22

Rewrite the following in the form “$\forall$ \_\_\_\_ $x$, if \_\_\_\_ then \_\_\_\_.”

### a

All Java programs have at least 5 lines.

## 28

Rewrite each statement without using quantifiers or variables. Indicate which are true and which are false, and justify your answers as best as you can.

Let the domain of $x$ be the set $D$ of objects discussed in mathematics courses, and let $\text{Real}(x)$ be “$x$ is a real number,” $\text{Pos}(x)$ be “$x$ is a positive real number,” $\text{Neg}(x)$ be “$x$ is a negative real number,” and $\text{Int}(x)$ be “$x$ is an integer.”

### a

$\text{Pos}(0)$

### b

$\forall x,\text{Real}(x)\land \text{Neg}(x)\to \text{Pos}(-x)$
