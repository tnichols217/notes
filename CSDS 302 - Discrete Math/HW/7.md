For each positive integer $n$, let $P(n)$ be the sentence that describes the following divisibility property:

$5^n-1$ is divisible by $4$.

### a

Write $P(0)$. Is $P(0)$ true?

### b

Write $P(k)$

### c

Write $P(k+1)$

### d

In a proof by mathematical induction that this divisibility property holds for every integer $n\ge0$, what must be shown in the inductive step?

For each positive integer n, let P(n) be the sentence

In any round-robin tournament involving $n$ teams, the teams can be labeled $T_1,T_2,T_3,...,T_n$, so that $T_i$ beats $T_{i+1}$ for every $i=1,2,...,n$.

### a

Write $P(2)$. Is $P(2)$ true?

### b

Write $P(k)$.

### c

Write $P(k+1)$

### d

In a proof by mathematical induction that $P(n)$ is true for each integer $n\ge2$, what must be shown in the inductive step?

Prove the statement by mathematical induction

$n(n^2+5)$ is divisible by $6$, for each integer $n\ge0$

The introductory example solved with ordinary mathematical induction in Section 5.3 can also be solved using strong mathematical induction. Let $P(n)$ be “any n¢ can be obtained using a combination of 3¢ and 5¢ coins.” Use strong mathematical induction to prove that $P(n)$ is true for every integer $n\ge8$.

## 13

Use strong mathematical induction to prove the existence part of the unique factorization of integers theorem (Theorem 4.4.5). In other words, prove that every integer greater than $1$ is either a prime number or a product of prime numbers.

## 16

Use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer $n\ge2$, if $n$ is even, then any sum of $n$ odd integers is even, and if $n$ is odd, then any sum of $n$ odd integers is odd.
