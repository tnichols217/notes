# 4.10

## 15-16

Use the euclidean algorithm to hand-calculate the greatest common divisors of each of the pairs of integers in 15â€“16.

### 15

$832$ and $10933$

### 16

$4131$ and $2431$

# 5.1

## 6

Write the first four terms of the sequence

$f_n=\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4}\right\rfloor\cdot 4$ for every integer $n\ge 1$

## 60

Rewrite as a single summation or product

$2\cdot\sum\limits_{k=1}^n(3k^2+4)+5\cdot\sum\limits_{k=1}^n(2k^2-1)$

# 5.2

## 3

For each positive integer $n$, let $P(n)$ be the formula

$1^2+2^2+...+n^2= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

### a

Write $P(1)$. Is $P(1)$ true?

### b

Write $P(k)$

### c

Write $P(k+1)$

### d

In a proof by mathematical induction that the formula holds for every integer $n\ge 1$, what must be shown in the inductive step?

## 7

Prove the statement using mathematical induction. Do not derive them from theorem 5.2.1 or theorem 5.2.2.

For every integer $n\ge1$
$1+6+11+16+...+(5n-4)= \frac{n(5n-3)}{2}$

## 12

Prove the statement using mathematical induction.

$\frac{1}{1\cdot 2}+\frac{1}{2\cdot 3}+...+\frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{n}{n+1}$ for every integer $n\ge 1$

## 29

Use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ integers and/or the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence to evaluate the sum or to write it in closed form.

$1-2+2^2-2^3+...+$
