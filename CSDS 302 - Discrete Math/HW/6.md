For each positive integer $n$, let $P(n)$ be the sentence that describes the following divisibility property:

$5^n-1$ is divisible by $4$.

### a

Write $P(0)$. Is $P(0)$ true?

> [!answer]
> $P(0)=0\vert 4$
> Yes, it is true

### b

Write $P(k)$

> [!answer]
> $5^k-1\vert 4$

### c

Write $P(k+1)$

> [!answer]
> $5^{k+1}-1\vert 4$

### d

In a proof by mathematical induction that this divisibility property holds for every integer $n\ge0$, what must be shown in the inductive step?

> [!answer]
> We must show that given $P(k)$, $P(k+1)$
> 
> $\exists n\in\mathbf Z$
> $5^k-1=4n$ Properties of divisibility
> $5^k=4n+1$
> $5^{k+1}=20n+5$
> $5^{k+1}=4(5n+1)+1$
> $5^{k+1}-1=4(5n+1)$
> $m=5n+1:m\in\mathbf Z$ Integers are closed on multiplication and addition
> $5^{k+1}-1=4m$
> $5^{k+1}-1\vert4$ Properties of divisibility
> $\therefore P(0), P(k)\to P(k+1)$
> $\square$

The introductory example solved with ordinary mathematical induction in Section 5.3 can also be solved using strong mathematical induction. Let $P(n)$ be “any n¢ can be obtained using a combination of 3¢ and 5¢ coins.” Use strong mathematical induction to prove that $P(n)$ is true for every integer $n\ge8$.

## 13

Use strong mathematical induction to prove the existence part of the unique factorization of integers theorem (Theorem 4.4.5). In other words, prove that every integer greater than $1$ is either a prime number or a product of prime numbers.

## 16

Use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer $n\ge2$, if $n$ is even, then any sum of $n$ odd integers is even, and if $n$ is odd, then any sum of $n$ odd integers is odd.
