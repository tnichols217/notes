# 1

Draw the state diagram for the following problem: There is one input $A$ and two outputs $X$ and $Y$. $X$ becomes $1$ if $A$ has been $1$ for at least three cycles altogether (not necessarily consecutively). $Y$ becomes $1$ if $A$ has been $1$ for at least two consecutive cycles.

# 2

Given the following excitation and output equations, write the state transition and output tables. $X$ is the input, $Z$ is the output. Draw the sequential logic circuit. Please note that state memory is using positive-edge triggered D flip-flops.

$D1 = Q1'+ Q1\cdot Q2$
$D2 = Q2'\cdot X'$
Z = Q1' + Q2
