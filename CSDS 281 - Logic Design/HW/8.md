# 1

Draw the state diagram for the following problem: There is one input $A$ and two outputs $X$ and $Y$. $X$ becomes $1$ if $A$ has been $1$ for at least three cycles altogether (not necessarily consecutively). $Y$ becomes $1$ if $A$ has been $1$ for at least two consecutive cycles.

Given the following excitation and output equations, write the state transition and output tables. $X$ is the input, $Z$ is the output. Draw the sequential logic circuit. Please note that state memory is using positive-edge triggered D flip-flops.

$D1 = Q1'+ Q1\cdot Q2$
$D2 = Q2'\cdot X'$
$Z = Q1' + Q2$

# 3

Design a 3-bit binary counter with counting sequence 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 3, ...
The counter will increment at each clock tick. Use binary state assignments. Use D flip-flops, and combinational logic gates.
Follow the steps below:
1. Draw a state diagram.
2. Write a state transition table.
3. Write state transition, and excitation equations.
4. Draw the circuit.

# 4

Design a 4-bit ripple up counter using only four D flip-flops.

# 5

Using two 74x163 counters, design a counter with counting sequence 0, 128, 129,..., 254, 255, 0, 128, 129, ... , 254, 255. Logic 0 and 1 are available.

# 6

Using one 74x169 and three inverters, design a counter with the counting sequence 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 4, 3 ...
