This code will advance to the next state if nothing is pressed after 1 second of inactivity.

If an incorrect button is pressed, the state will immediately shift over to the error light.
If a correct button is pressed and no incorrect buttons are pressed, then the state will immediately shift over to the OK light.

While in the error state or OK state, the state will not change until all buttons are unpressed. A one second delay will begin once all buttons are unpressed. Pressing buttons during this cooldown state will reset the cooldown.

Once the cooldown is finished in the ERR or OK state, return to the S1 state.

This code when run on 25kHz instruction frequency has cooldowns accurate to exactly $0.99996~\text{s}$

![[Pasted image 20240502011118.png]]
At $1.00004~\text s$, we progress into state 2, with the its corresponding LED on, as there has been no interaction with the device yet

![[Pasted image 20240502011137.png]]
At $1.30036~\text s$, we progress into the error state as all buttons were pressed at $1.3~\text s$ while the correct state was 2

![[Pasted image 20240502011324.png]]
At $3.3998~\text s$, we progress back into S1 as all buttons were released at $2.4~\text s$

![[Pasted image 20240502011353.png]]
At $3.50028~\text s$, we progress into the success state, as the first button was pressed at $3.5~\text s$, $0.1~\text s$ after moving to S1.

![[Pasted image 20240502013245.png]]
At $7.40052~\text s$, we progress back into the error state as the wrong button was pressed
