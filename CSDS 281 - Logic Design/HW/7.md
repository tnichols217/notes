# 1

Implement the following functions using only 74x138 binary decoders and NAND gates

$F=\prod\limits_{A,B,C}(0,1,4,5,6)$
$F=\sum\limits_{W,X,Y,Z}(1,4,6,9,11,15)$

# 2

Design a 10-to-4 encoder with the inputs 1-out-of-10 code and outputs coded normally for 0 – 7 (binary 0000 - 0111) and 8 is coded as E (1110) and 9 is coded as F (1111). Show the internal circuit.

# 3

Implement the following function using only a single 4×1 multiplexer and inverters

| a   | b   | c   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
