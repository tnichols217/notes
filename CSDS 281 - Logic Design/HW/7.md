| a   | b   | c   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   |

For the logic expressions given below, find all of the static hazards and design a hazard-free circuit that realizes the same logic function. Write the functions that are hazard free, you do not need to draw the circuit. (Hint: Use Karnaugh maps to find the timing hazards.)

## a

$F=W\cdot X+W'\cdot Y'$

## b

$F=W\cdot Y+W'\cdot Z'+X\cdot Y'\cdot Z$
