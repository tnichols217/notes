Simplify the following functions using Karnaugh maps

## a


$F=\sum\limits_{w,x,y,z}(0,1,4,5,7,10,11,14,15)$

## b

$F=\sum\limits_{w,x,y,z}(0,2,3,4,6,9,10,11,15)$

# 2

For the logic expressions given below, find all of the static hazards and design a hazard-free circuit that realizes the same logic function. Write the functions that are hazard free, you do not need to draw the circuit. (Hint: Use Karnaugh maps to find the timing hazards.)
