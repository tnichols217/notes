# 2

Indicate whether there is an overflow for the following operations where all the numbers are in two’s complement form

$10010100 + 10010101$
$01000011 + 10010001$

> [!answer]
> $10010100+10010101=100101001$
> Yes, since both of the leading digits are high, this leads the output to be too large to store in $8$ bits, making it overflow to $9$. Truncating it to $8$ bits will make it have an inaccurate answer.
> 
> $01000011+10010001=11010100$
> No, since only one leading digit is high and there is no carry over from the previous bit, there is no overflow.

# 3

Perform the following operations by first representing the decimal numbers in two’s complement number system. (Hint: the subtraction will become addition). Use 6 bits to represent the numbers.

$14-15=?$
$12-10=?$
$24-6=?$
$8-22=?$

> [!answer]
> $14-15=(8+4+2)-()?$
> $12-10=?$
> $24-6=?$
> $8-22=?$

# 4

Complete the following table so that each row is the same number in four different representations. For binary numbers, use six bits.

| Decimal | Signed Magnitude | Two's Complement | One's Complement |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| -14 |  |  |  |
|  | 110110 |  |  |
|  |  | 010011 |  |
|  |  |  | 110111 |

# 5

Add the following unsigned numbers:

$9B4C_{16}+12E3_{16}=?$
$234_8+436_8=?$
