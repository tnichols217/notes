# Congruence

## Definition

$a\equiv b\mod N$
$\iff N|(a-b)$

$[a]_{N}$ is defined as the set of all numbers that are congruent to $a$ in base $N$

## Common rules

1. Transitive: $a\equiv b,b\equiv c\implies a\equiv c$
2. Additive: $[a]_{N}+[b]_{N}=[a+b]_{N}$
2. Multiplicative: $[a]_{N}[b]_{N}=[ab]_{N}$
