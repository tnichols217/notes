> Compute the following discrete logarithms.

> **(a)** $\log_2(13)$ for the prime $23$, i.e. $p=23$, $g=2$, and you must solve the congruence $2^x \equiv 13 \pmod {23}$.

> **(b)** $\log_{10}(22)$ for the prime $p=47$.

**(a)** $2^7 \equiv 13 \pmod {23}$

**(b)** $10^{11} \equiv 22 \pmod {47}$

**(c)** Using the table in the book we see $627^{18} \equiv 608 \pmod {941}$.

> Alice and Bob agree to use the prime $p = 1373$ and the base $g = 2$ for a Diffie–Hellman key exchange. Alice sends Bob the value $A = 974$. Bob asks your assistance, so you tell him to use the secret exponent $b = 871$. What value $B$ should Bob send to Alice, and what is their secret shared value? Can you figure out Alice’s secret exponent?
