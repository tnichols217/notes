## 5.21

We continue with the coin tossing scenario from Example 5.23, so our experiment consists in tossing a fair coin ten times. Compute the probabilities of the following events.

### a

The first and last tosses are both heads.

> [!answer]
> $(0.5)(0.5)=0.25$

### b

Either the first toss or the last toss (or both) are heads.

> [!answer]
> $0.5+0.5(0.5)=0.75$

### c

Either the first toss or the last toss (but not both) are heads.

> [!answer]
> $(0.5)(0.5)+(0.5)(0.5)=0.5$

### d

There are exactly k heads and 10 âˆ’ k tails. Compute the probability for each value of k between 0 and 10. (Hint. To save time, note that the probability of exactly k heads is the same as the probability of exactly k tails.)

### e

There is an even number of heads.

> [!answer]
> The sum of all the even numbers
> 
> $0.50002$ (possible rounding error)

### f

There is an odd number of heads.

> [!answer]
> $0.50001$ (another possible rounding error)

## Entropy

Consider a cryptosystem with $M = \{a,b,c\}$, $K = \{K1,K2,K3\}$, and $C= \{1,2,3,4\}$.

Suppose the encryption rules are as follows:

|     | a   | b   | c   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1  | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| K2  | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| K3  | 3   | 4   | 1   |

Assume the keys are equiprobable, and the plaintext probabilities are:

$P(a)= 1/2$, $P(b) = 1/3$, and $P(c)=1/6$.

### 1

$H(M)$

> [!answer]
> $H(M)=-\left( \frac{1}{2}\log_{2}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3}\log_{2}\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)+\frac{1}{6}\log_{2}\left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \right)$
> $=1.46~\text{bits}$

### 2

$H(K)$

> [!answer]
> $\log_{2}(3)=1.58~\text{bits}$

### 3

$H(C)$

> [!answer]
> $P(C=1)=\frac{2}{9}$
> $P(C=2)=\frac{5}{18}$
> $P(C=3)=\frac{1}{3}$
> $P(C=4)=\frac{1}{6}$
> 
> $H(C)=1.87~\text{bits}$

### 4

$H(K|C)$

> [!answer]
> ![[tables#^4a]]
> ![[tables#^4b]]
> 
> $\frac{2}{9}\cdot0.8113+\frac{5}{18}\cdot0.9710+\frac{1}{3}\cdot1.4591+\frac{1}{6}0.9183$
> $=1.089~\text{bits}$

### 5

$H(M|C)$

> [!answer]
> $H(M|C)=H(M)+H(K)-H(C)$
> $=1.17~\text{bits}$
