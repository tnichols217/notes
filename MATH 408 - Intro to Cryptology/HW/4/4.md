## 2.8

Alice and Bob agree to use the prime $p=1373$ and the base $g=2$ for communications using the El-Gamal public key cryptosystem.

### a

Alice's private key is $a=947$. What is her public key $A$?

> [!answer]
> $A\equiv g^{a}\mod p$
> $A\equiv 177$

### b

Bob has private key $b=716$ and public key $B=469$. Alice encrypts message $m=583$ with nonce $k=877$. What ciphertext does she send to Bob?

> [!answer]
> $c_{1}=g^{k}\mod p=719$
> $c_{2}=mB^{k}=1296$
> 
> $c=(719, 1296)$

### c

Alice gets new private key $a=299$ and public key $A=34$. Bob sends message ($661,1325$) using this new public key. Decrypt the message.

> [!answer]
> $x=c_{1}^{p-1-a}=794$
> $m=c_{2}x=332$
> 
> $332$

### d

Bob has new public key $B=893$. Alice sends him the message ($693,793$). Eve manages to solve the discrete log problem(with generous assistance from you) and uses $b$ to decrypt the message. What is the message?

> [!answer]
> $k=932$
> $A^{k}=431$
> $A^{-k}=532$
> $m=365$
