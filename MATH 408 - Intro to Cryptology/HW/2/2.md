Consider the affine cipher with key $k=(k_1, k_2)$, whose encryption and decryption functions are given by
- $e_k(m) = k_1 \cdot m + k_2 \pmod p$
- $d_k(c) = k_1' \cdot (c-k_2) \pmod p$ where $k_1' = k_1^{-1} \pmod p$.

### a

Let $p=541$ and let the key be $(34, 71)$. Encrypt the message $m=204$. Decrypt the ciphertext $c=431$.

> [!answer]
> $e_{k}(204)=34\cdot204+71\pmod{541}$
> $\equiv515$
> 
> $k_{1}'=366$
> 
> $d_{k}(431)=366\cdot(431-71)\pmod{541}$
> $\equiv297$

### b

Assuming that $p$ is public knowledge, explain why the affine cipher is vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack. How many plaintext/ciphertext pairs are likely to be needed in order to recover the private key?

> [!answer]
> Two pairs are enough to determine the original private key pair.

> With two pairs, we can easily solve a linear system for both of the private key values.

### c

Alice and Bob decide to use the prime $p = 601$ for their affine cipher. The value of $p$ is public knowledge, and Eve intercepts the ciphertexts $c_1=324$ and $c_2=381$ and also manages to find out that the corresponding plaintexts are $m_1=387$ and $m_2=491$. Determine the private key and then use it to encrypt the message $m_3=173$.

> $387k_{1}+k_{2}\equiv324\pmod{601}$
> $491k_{1}+k_{2}\equiv381\pmod{601}$
> $104k_{1}\equiv57\pmod{601}$
> $104^{-1}=549$
> $k_{1}\equiv549(57)\pmod{601}$
> $k_{1}\equiv41\pmod{601}$
> $k_{2}\equiv83\pmod{601}$
> $k=(41, 83)$
> 
> $e_{k}(173)=173\cdot 41+83\pmod{601}$
> $e_{k}(173)\equiv565\pmod{601}$
> $173\to565$

### d

Suppose now that $p$ is not public knowledge. Is the affine cipher still vulnerable to a known plaintext attack? If so, how many plaintext/ciphertext pairs are likely to be needed in order to recover the private key?

> [!answer]
> Yes, it would take at least 3 unique pairs to find $k,p$.
> 
> Given two pairs $(m_{1},c_{1}),(m_{2},c_{2})$, we know:
> $c_{1}=k_{1}\cdot m_{1}+k_{2}\mod p$
> $c_{2}=k_{1}\cdot m_{2}+k_{2}\mod p$
> $\implies c_{1}-c_{2}=k_{1}(m_{1}-m_{2})\mod p$
> 
> With a second pairing $(m_{2},c_{2}),(m_{3},c_{3})$,
> $\implies c_{2}-c_{3}=k_{1}(m_{2}-m_{3})\mod p$
> 
> $\implies(c_{1}-c_{2})(m_{2}-m_{3})=(c_{2}-c_{3})(m_{1}-m_{2})\mod p$
> $\implies(c_{1}-c_{2})(m_{2}-m_{3})-(c_{2}-c_{3})(m_{1}-m_{2})=0\mod p$
> 
> Therefore, this expression has $p$ as a factor.
> Through trial and error of the factors of that expression, we are able to determine $p$ fairly easily.

Alice and Bob choose a key space $\mathcal{K}$ containing $2^{56}$ keys. Eve builds a special purpose computer that can check $10^{10}$ keys per second.

### a

How many days does it take Eve to check half the keys in $\mathcal{K}$?

> [!answer]
> $\frac{2^{55}}{10^{10}\cdot 60\cdot 60\cdot 24}=41.69999654972681$
> $\approx42$ days

### b

Alice and Bob replace their key space with a larger set containing $2^B$ keys. How large should Alice and Bob choose $B$ in order to force Eve's computer to spend 100 years checking half the keys?

> [!answer]
> $100\cdot365.25\cdot24\cdot60\cdot60\cdot10^{10}=2^{64.77462129339004}$
> $B\ge65.77$
> $B=66$
