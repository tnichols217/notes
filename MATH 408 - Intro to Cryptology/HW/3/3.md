## 2.4

Compute the following discrete logarithms.

### a

$\log_2(13)$ for the prime $23$, i.e. $p=23$, $g=2$, and you must solve the congruence $2^x \equiv 13 \pmod {23}$.

> [!answer]
> $2^{7}\equiv 13\pmod{23}$

### b

$\log_{10}(22)$ for the prime $p=47$.

> [!answer]
> $10^{11}\equiv22\pmod{47}$

### c

$\log_{627}(608)$ for the prime $p=941$.

> [!answer]
> $627^{18}\equiv608\pmod{941}$

### Source

Wrote and used this simple python script:

```python
def find_log(b, v, p):
	c = 1
	prod = b
	while prod != v:
		c += 1
		prod = (prod*b) % p
	return c
```

## 2.6

Alice and Bob agree to use the prime $p = 1373$ and the base $g = 2$ for a Diffie–Hellman key exchange. Alice sends Bob the value $A = 974$. Bob asks your assistance, so you tell him to use the secret exponent $b = 871$. What value $B$ should Bob send to Alice, and what is their secret shared value? Can you figure out Alice’s secret exponent?
