Prove that $x^3 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_{2}[x]$.

> [!answer]
> In order for $x^{3}+x+1$ to be irreducible, it must not be divisible by $x$ or $x+1$.
> Since $x^{3}+x+1=(x^{2}+1)(x)+1=(x^{2}+x)(x+1)+1$,
> and $1$ is not divisible by $x$ or $x+1$, our polynomial is also not divisible.
> 
> Thus, our polynomial is irreducible.
