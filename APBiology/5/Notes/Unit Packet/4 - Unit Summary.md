# AP Biology Standards:

-   Construct a representation that connects the process of meiosis to the passage of traits from parent to offspring.
    
-   Pose questions about the ethical, social, or medical issues surrounding human genetic disorders.
    
-   Apply mathematical routines to determine Mendelian patterns of inheritance provided by data sets.
    
-   Explain deviations from Mendel’s model of the inheritance of traits.
    
-   Explain how the inheritance patterns of many traits cannot be accounted for by Mendelian genetics
    
-   Describe representations of an appropriate example of inheritance patterns that cannot be explained by Mendel’s model of the inheritance of traits.
    
-   Construct explanations of the influence of environmental factors on the phenotype of an organism.
    
-   Use evidence to justify a claim that a variety of phenotypic responses to a single environmental factor can result from different genotypes within the population.

# Objectives:

-   How are traits passed from one generation to the next?
    
-   How do eukaryotic cells store, retrieve, and transmit genetic information?
    
-   How does genotype affect phenotype?
    
-   How are genotype and human disorder related?
