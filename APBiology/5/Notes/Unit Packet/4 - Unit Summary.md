# AP Biology Standards:

-   Construct a representation that connects the process of meiosis to the passage of traits from parent to offspring.
	- Traits from parent's parents are combined almost completely randomly to produce a single copy of all DNA passed into the haploid cell
	- Haploid cells from mom and dad are combined into the offspring
-   Pose questions about the ethical, social, or medical issues surrounding human genetic disorders.
	- Should we prevent these people form reproducing so that these disorders could be irradiated? or do they still have the right to harm future people with their choice.
-   Apply mathematical routines to determine Mendelian patterns of inheritance provided by data sets.
	- Basically each combo is 25%, and if one is seen multiple times, add the 25%s together
-   Explain deviations from Mendel’s model of the inheritance of traits.
	- Linked traits, they do not recombine completely randomly independently
-   Explain how the inheritance patterns of many traits cannot be accounted for by Mendelian genetics
	- Often things that do not follow will inherit similarly but with different chances
	- For other things it tends to be multiple genes, which most commonly is just a range of expression
-   Construct explanations of the influence of environmental factors on the phenotype of an organism.
-   Use evidence to justify a claim that a variety of phenotypic responses to a single environmental factor can result from different genotypes within the population.

# Objectives:

-   How are traits passed from one generation to the next?
-   How do eukaryotic cells store, retrieve, and transmit genetic information?
-   How does genotype affect phenotype?
-   How are genotype and human disorder related?
