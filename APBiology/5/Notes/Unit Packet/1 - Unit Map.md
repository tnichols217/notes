# 5.1 Meiosis
Meiosis is a process that ensures the formation of haploid gamete cells in sexually reproducing diploid organisms

Meiosis results in daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.

Meiosis involves two rounds of a sequential series of steps (meiosis I and meiosis II).

# 5.2 Meiosis and Genetic Diversity
Separation of the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I ensures that each gamete receives a haploid (1n) set of chromosomes that comprises of both maternal and paternal chromosomes.

During meiosis I, homologous chromatids exchange genetic material via a process called “crossing over” (recombination), which increases genetic diversity among the resultant gametes.

Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes involving gamete formation - including crossing over, the random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, and subsequent fertilization of gametes - serves to increase variation.  

# 5.3 Mendelian Genetics

DNA and RNA are carriers of genetic information.

Ribosomes are found in all forms of life.

Major features of the genetic code are shared by all modern living systems.

Core metabolic pathways are conserved across all currently recognized domains.

Medel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment can be applied to genes that are on different chromosomes.

Fertilization involves the fusion of two haploid gametes. Restoring the diploid number of chromosomes and increasing genetic variation in populations by creating new combinations of alleles in the zygote -  
Rules of probability can be applied to analyze passage of single gene traits from parent to offspring.  
The pattern of interitance (monohybrid, dihybrid, sex-linked, and genetically linked genes) can often be predicted from data, including pedigree, that give the parent genotype/phenotype and the offspting genotypes/phenotypes.  
RELEVANT EQUATION  
Laws of Probability  
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then: P ( A or B) = P (A) + P(B)  
If A and B are independent, then: P ( A or B) = P (A) x P(B)

# 5.4 Non-Mendelian Genetics

Patterns of inheritance of many traits do not follow ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws and can be identified by quantitative analysis, where observed phenotypic ratios statistically differ from predicted ratios -  
Genes that are adjacent and close to one another on the same chromosome may appear to be genetically linked; the probability that genetically linked genes will segregate as a unit can be used to calculate the map distance between them.

Some traits are determined by genes on sex chromosomes and are known as sex-linked traits. The pattern of inheritance of sex-linked traits can often be predicted from data, including pedigree, indicating the parent genotype/phenotype and the offspring genotypes/phenotypes.

Many traits are the product of multiple genes and/or physiological processes acting in combination; these traits therefore do not segregate in Mendelian patterns.

Some traits result from non-nuclear inheritance -  
Chloroplasts and mitochondria are randomly assorted to gametes and daughter cells; thus, traits determined by chloroplasts and mitochondrial DNA do not follow simple Mendelian rules.

In animals, mitochondria are transmitted by the egg and not by sperm; as such, traits determined by mitochondrial DNA are maternally inherited.

In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts are transmitted in the ovule and not in the pollen; as such, mitochondria -determined and chloroplast -determined traits are maternally inherited.

# 5.5 Environmental Effects on Phenotype

Environmental factors influence gene expression and can lead to phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity occurs when individuals with the same genotype exhibit different phenotypes in different environments.

# 5.6 Chromosomal Inheritance

Segregation, independent assortment of chromosomes, and fertilization result in genetic variation in populations.

The chromosomal basis of inheritance provides an understanding of the pattern of transmission of genes from parent to offspring.

Certain human genetic disorders can be attributed to the inheritance of a single affected or mutated allele or specific chromosomal changes, such as nondisjunction.
