1. Linked genes are on the same chromosome, so their recombination rate is not completely random and often tends to be lower depending on the distance on the chromosome
2. The chances of recombining depending on the distance from each other
3. Parental means that you get all the same genes of a certain chromosome from one of your grandparents (because your parent's DNA was never recombined), but when it is recombined, you get a mix of both grandparents from that parent
4. It doesnt depend on only one gene and alleles, it uses a combination of multiple factors to determine the phenotype, which is not completely random and certain results will be more common than others depending on the type of multi gene inheritance
5. Most of the time non-nuclear inheritance means we just get it from our mother because the sperm does not contain much other than the genetic material. No organelles with DNA are there. This is also why polar bodies are created during the production of eggs.
6. Different environmental factors define the phenotype of the hydrangeas, and not simply just genetically inherited.
