1. Redundant, continuous, universal
2. Because it shares similar DNA and function across many different organisms
3. You will always have one gene from the top and one from the side, never two from one
4. It shows the different probabilities of combinations of genes in gamete production
5. You can easily visualize the inheritance pattern across generations and have multiple examples of different combos
