# Elephant Worksheet 2

## Topics

- I can explain how density-dependent and density independent factors impact elephant populations
- I can collect evidence to support the claim that cooperation increases fitness
- I can compare and contrast types of reproductive strategies
- I can explain the selective pressure that has been placed on a tuskless elephant population

## Investigate: Elephant Tusks

-Both male and female elephants have tusks, which start to grow in after baby elephants lose their primary teeth in their first year of life.
-Elephants use their tusks all the time. “Prying bark from trees; digging for water, roots, or minerals; [or] fighting other bull elephants—tusks perform a variety of functions.”

> [!question] Measure the elephant tusk shown in diagram in cm
> 10cm

The pulp cavity is connected to the elephant’s face. How much of the tusk is in the elephant’s skull?

> [!question] Look at a 3D model of an elephant skull. Pose a question about elephant tusks
> How did their structure evolve to support strong tusks.

## Claim: Cooperative Behavior increases fitness and success of young elephants.

Elephants live in tightly-bonded female-led herds. This is led by the oldest and often largest female in the herd, called a matriarch. Herds usually consist of 8-100 individuals, depending on terrain and family size. When a calf is born, it is raised and protected by the whole matriarchal herd.

> [!question] Using the graphs,  provide at least 2 pieces of evidence to support claim
> Those with siblings tend to have larger standard body mass implying better fitness. With a Female as elder, it also increases chances of survival, whilst the opposite decreases.

Elephants are K species. Did you know that they are pregnant for 18-22 months??

> [!question] How might this slow the conservation effort to save elephants?
> Their generation time is much longer, meaning it takes longer to rebound the population

> [!question] What is the advantage to k-selection? Disadvantage?
> Increases survival of offspring, but decreases adaptability.

> [!question] What is the advantage to r-selection? Disadvantage?
> More offspring and increases adaptability, but decreased survival rate.

Optional: Meet the orphan calves

## Populations of Elephants

> [!question] What makes a population?
> Groups of individuals of the same species that rely on similar resources that occupy the same area

> [!question] What are density dependent factors that affect elephants?
> Competition for land, resources, disease

> [!question] What are density independent factors that affect elephants?
> Natural Disasters

> [!question] Using info from graph, How have African elephant populations changed over time?
> Decreased significantly over time

![[Pasted image 20230506184504.png]]

> [!question] Using the data table, what species are at risk of extinction today?
> African Forest Elephant

## Threats elephants face

Read information from the San Diego Zoo website regarding population statistics to see what common threats elephants face:   <http://ielc.libguides.com/c.php?g=692888&p=4908857>

## Threat Notes

Watch: How much is your face worth?

> [!question] What stood out from this PSA?
> The tusks are attached to their skull, so to take them then you have to rip off their faces.

## Tusklessness population case study

Watch the video clip at <http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/selection-tuskless-elephants>

> [!question] What is unusual about the elephant populations found in Gorongosa now?
> Increased significantly due to artificial selection

> [!question] How does an elephant use its tusks?
> Dig holes, fight, and hunt.

> [!question] What would probably happen to a male elephant that doesn’t have tusks?
> Can't fight or hunt.

Therefore, tusklessness in male elephants is a rare trait.

> [!question] How did the civil war affect elephant populations?
> Increased the tusked population

> [!question] Dr. Poole noticed a high proportion of tuskless elephants after the war.  But why did males still have their tusks?
> Tuskless elephants could not fight for themselves, so they lost.

> [!question] What was the selective pressure that increased the numbers of tuskless elephants?
> Hunting for ivory

> [!question] Explain how this selective pressure shifted the population to be more tuskless.
> It killed off all the tusked ones so then the allele frequency of the tuskless population increased.

> [!question] Write an explanation based on natural selection for the high incidence of tusklessness among female elephants in Gorongosa.Highlight vocab: variation, differential reproduction, trait, variation, inherit, DNA
> They dont need to fight, so they increased in population due to the hunting, yet tusked males survived because they can basically destroy all the tuskless ones.

## Review Questions

In elephants, no tusks (t) is sex-linked recessive tusks (T).

1. If a tuskless female mates with a male with tusks, what % females and males will be tusk-less?
   - 0% tuskless F
   - 100% tuskless M
2. In elephants, no tusks (t) is sex-linked recessive tusks (T). If a pure tusked female mates with a male without tusks, what % females and males will be tusk-less?
   - 0% tuskless F
   - 0% tuskless M
3. In elephants, big ears eyes (E) is dominant to small ears(e). If two heterozygous parents mate, what percent will have small ears?
   - 25% small ears
4. In elephants, big ears eyes (E) is dominant to small ears(e). If a homo dominant parent mate with a homo recessive parent, what percent will have small ears?
   - 0% small ears
