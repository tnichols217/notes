# Elephant Worksheet 3

## Topics

- I can compare organism relationships

## Investigate: Gel electrophoresis

### Gel 1

![[Pasted image 20230506201207.png]]
Count the  bands on  sample A, B and C in gel 1

Sample A
Sample B
Sample C

The fragments that traveled the furthest are smaller/larger

### Gel 2

#### Where in Africa Did the Tusks Come From?

The tusks were shipped from a port in Tanzania. Did they come from elephants in that country, or were they transported there from other parts of Africa? You will use data from a reference map of genetic profiles of elephant populations that was built using DNA isolated from dung!

> [!question] Compare the ivory sample to pop A or pop B. Is the ivory sample more like population A or population B?

> [!question] What’s your evidence?

The left lane shows a DNA ladder and lanes A–D show the alleles for Marker X present in each elephant population. Remember that each population profile consists of the alleles from several individual dung samples.

A researcher collected DNA from five dung samples in an elephant population. She amplified the sequence corresponding to the STR locus called "Marker X" and determined each allele's size using gel electrophoresis. The data are shown in the table. Samples that have an identical fragment for both alleles are homozygous for Marker X. If the alleles are different, the individual is heterozygous.

> [!question] Which of the lanes shown at left corresponds to the Marker X profile for this population?

## Elephants and Other Species

| Relationshp  | Description | Is this a ++ += +0 | Species Examples |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Mutualism    |             |                    |                  |
| Commensalism |             |                    |                  |
| Prasitism    |             |                    |                  |

### Example 1

Oxpeckers and cattle egrets are two species of birds that land on elephants and spend their days eating lice, ticks, and other parties out of the elephants' skin and hair. The elephants benefit by having dangerous critters removed from their bodies, and the oxpeckers get a snack and a free ride.

### Example 2

The dung beetle retrieves its nourishment from the elephant’s dung, while on the other hand, the elephants are totally indifferent to what happens to its waste.

### Example 3

The elephant-specific intestinal fluke Protofasciola robusta, likely to be an ancestral species within the Fasciolidae (Lotfy et al., 2008), has been associated with intestinal tissue damage, hemorrhage and death in free-ranging African elephants

### Example 4

In Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa, olive baboons and elephants have formed a symbiotic relationship. The baboons drink from water holes dug by the elephants, and the elephants rely on baboons sitting in the treetops to alert them to danger.

> [!question] Look at the African continent, make observations on the elephant populations?

> [!question] Pose a question about populations in different countries

![[Pasted image 20230506201926.png]]

> [!question] What is the rate of growth in this population between 1950 and 1960?

> [!question] Is this logistic or exponential growth?

![[Pasted image 20230506201935.png]]

> [!question] What is the rate of growth in this population between 1975 and 2000?

> [!question] Is this logistic or exponential growth?

## Population formulas review questions

![[Pasted image 20230506202033.png]]

1. A pop of 23,473 elephants has 2,342 births and 473 deaths. What is the growth rate for this population?

2. One thousand two hundred and seventy deer are living on an island that is eight hundred and thirty square kilometers in size. What is the population density of the deer per square kilometer?

3. In 2002, 16.47 million babies were born in China. What was the birth rate (as a percentage and per 1000)?

4. There are 252 elephants in a population. There is no net immigration or emigration. If 47 elephants die and 32 elephants are born in one month, what is the population size at the end of the month? Round to the nearest whole number.

5. In a population of 600 squirrels, the per capita birth rate in a particular period is 0.06 and the per capita death rate is 0.12. What is the per capita growth rate of the population? Round to the nearest hundredth.

6. If rmax = 1.0 and carrying capacity (K) = 1,500, calculate the population growth rate, where population size (N) = 1,600. What is happening to this population?
