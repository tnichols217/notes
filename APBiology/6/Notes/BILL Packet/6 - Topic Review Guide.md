- Concept 13.2: Many Proteins work together in DNA Replication and Repair pgs. 251-259
	- Power Line: How is genetic information copied for transmission between generations?
		- DNA is condensed into chromosomes, then replicated with DNA polymerase, then it is separated to the two poles of the cell when it splits into two.
		- When it is being passed on into gametes, only one of each gene is passed instead of two to each cell, which then gets recombined with the other parent in order to form a full genome
- Concept 13.3: A chromosome consists of a DNA molecule packed together with proteins pgs. 259-260
	- Power Line: How does the organization of chromosomes impact DNA Replication?
		- It effects how the genes are inherited when going through reproduction, as genes closer to each other on the chromosome are less likely to be recombined, meaning the child will likely have both genes together
- Concept 14.2: Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA - a closer look pgs. 274-276
	- Power Line: What is the importance of the genetic flow from DNA to RNA?
		- DNA stores the information, RNA copies it and makes it ready to be used in the cell
- Concept 14.4: Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of a polypeptide - a closer look pgs. 279-286
	- Power Line: How does translation generate polypeptides that determine genotypes?
		- Polypeptides are the expression of genes, so they are by definition what shows from the genetic code of DNA
- Concept 14.5: Mutations of one or a few nucleotides can affect protein structure and function pgs. 288-290
	- Power Line: How does the various types of mutations impact genotype and phenotype?
		- Mutations can change the genetic code of a gene, changing the resulting protein and therefore the phenotype and genotype if the mutation is sensical
- Figure 15.3: The trp operon in E. coli - regulated synthesis of repressible enzymes pg. 295
	- Power Line: How is the trp operon repressible?
		- When tryptophan is present, the transcription of the gene is turned off
- Figure 15.4: The lac operon in E.coli - regulated synthesis of inducible enzymes pg. 296
	- Power Line: How is the lac operon an inducible?
		- It is off by default, but in the lack of glucose and surplus of lactose, the gene will turn on to digest the lactose
- Figure 15.6: Stages in gene expression that can be regulated in eukaryotic cells pg. 298
	- Power Line: In what ways do eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression?

# Recall and Review
## DNA Structure and Replication
  DNA Structure and Replication
1. Explain how the experiments that each of the following people/groups of people performed provided evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
	1. Frederick Griffith
		- Did the killing bateria experiment to prove that dead DNA can be picked up and used (R cells replicating dead S cells)
	2. Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod
		- Remove protein, RNA, and DNA separately to see which mattered in cell division, and proved that DNA was essential
	3. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase
		- Proved that DNA was the carrier of genetic material through experiment with radiolabeled bacteriophages
	4. Erwin Chargaff 
		- Proved A and T, and G and C match in DNA by measuring how much of each are in the DNA
2. Explain what is meant by “antiparallel” orientation of DNA.
	- The two strands of DNA point in opposite directions even though they are bound to each other
3. Describe the four essential functions of the genetic material.  Explain how the structure proposed by Watson and Crick makes these functions possible.
	- Store hereditary information
	- Recombining to produce variation
	- Useful for producing a result (creating proteins)
	- Can be replicated and passed on to inherit information
4. Create a t-chart that compares DNA to RNA.  Include structure, location and function of both molecules in your comparison.
	- DNA double strand, antiparallel, ATCG, nucleolus, makes RNA
	- RNA single strand, AUCG, nucleolus, cytoplasm, makes protein
5. Meselson and Stahl claimed that the replication of DNA was semiconservative.  Describe the evidence they used to support their claim.
	- When radiolabeling DNA and reproducing, each new strand of DNA will have one radiolabeled strand, and when reproducing again, only half of the remaining strains have one strand of radiolabeled DNA
6. Describe what the role of the following enzymes is in DNA replication: 
	1. DNA polymerase
		- makes DNA from DNA
	2. DNA ligase 
		- Patches up the okazaki fragments
	3. DNA primase
		- Gets the DNA polymerase ready to replicated the DNA
7. Explain why the leading strand of DNA is replicated continuously, while the lagging strand is replicated discontinuously.
	- Replication happens in the 5 -> 3 direction, so one strand will be following the strand and one will be going the other direction in chunks
8. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates the differences between the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
	- Prokaryotes have circular DNA and only start from one point, they are also significantly faster
	- Eukaryotes dont have circular DNA and have to take extra precautions for the telomeres, they also replicate at multiple places at once
9. Describe the relationship between the following organizational units of DNA: 
	1. DNA
		- All the genetic info
	2. Nucleosomes
	3. Chromatin
		- The unwound DNA
	4. Chromosome
		- Wound up DNA, ready for replication
	5. Transcription and Translation
		- Reading the DNA to make protein through RNA

## Transcription and Translation
1. Compare the processes of DNA replication with transcription.  Be sure to include the following things in your comparison: 
	1. Location of process	
		- Replication in nucleolus while transcription also happens in the same place, but leaves into the cytoplasm
	2. Nucleic acids involved
		- ATCG vs AUCG
	3. Enzymes responsible
		- DNA polymerase vs RNA polymerase, Ribosomes
2. Create a graphic organizer that explains the relationship between the following molecules: 
	1. DNA
		- origin of genetic info
	2. mRNA
		- transcribed DNA
	3. tRNA
		- RNA that connects sequences of mRNA to amino acids
	4. rRNA
		- RNA that folds up into ribosomes in order to facilitate protein production
	5. RNAi
		- RNA that binds to other RNA to prevent it from creating proteins, it eventually breaks down each other
3. Describe the difference between an intron and an exon. 
	- Exons get used to create the final protein, Intons do not
4. Eukaryotic mRNA is often modified before it leaves the nucleus. Describe how this happens.
	- Introns are removed, and a cap and poly a tail are added
5. Explain how the production of eukaryotic mRNA is like watching a tv show that is on Netflix.
	- It reads and copies what it sees
6. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates the differences between the processes of transcription and translation, including how they operate in prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes.
	- Transcription is DNA -> mRNA while translation is mRNA -> proteins
7. Explain the relationship between protein synthesis and an organism’s phenotype.
	- Phenotype is a trait that is displayed, protein synthesis is just what is produced from active genes, which may influence the phenotype
8. Explain how the “one-gene-one protein” hypothesis was derived by Beadle and Tatum.  Why has this hypothesis been refined to “one gene-one polypeptide,” and now “one gene-one (protein) domain?”
	- Proteins can be made up of more than one polypeptide chain, and sometimes the gene has to be modified drastically before it is made into a protein

## Mutations
1. Create a t-chart that explains the difference between somatic mutations and germline mutations.
	- Germline happens before the fertilization of the egg, so damaged DNA is passed to the entire new organism, while somatic is after, so only portions are effected by it
2. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates how point mutations differ from chromosomal mutations.  Which one has a greater effect on the organism’s phenotype?
	- Chromosomal, because a lot more DNA material is effected by it
3. Create a diagram that represents the following types of mutations:
	1. Silent mutation
		- Different bases, same amino acid
	2. Missense mutation
		- Different base, different amino acid
	3. Nonsense mutation
		- Different base, early start or early stop
	4. Frameshift mutation
		- Entire Sequence after mutation is effected, changing every amino acid after the mutation
4. Create a t-chart that compares gene mutations to chromosomal mutations
	- gene mutations are small, chromosomal mutations cause entire sections to be moved around of made ineffective
5. Explain what would happen to the process of gene expression if the gene for RNA polymerase was mutated.
	- Likely, no RNA will be able to be made, and therefore no proteins
6. Each amino acid has a tRNA synthetase enzyme that is responsible for attaching it to a tRNA molecule. Explain what would happen if there was a mutation in the gene encoding one of these enzymes.
	- Certain amino acids will not be able to be used in the production of proteins and the tRNA sequences for that amino acid will be nonfuctional
7. Describe how proteins can be altered once they have been synthesized at the ribosome and what organelles are involved.
	- They may be folded differently, added more parts to it, combined to other proteins

## Gene Regulation
1. Define operon.  Explain how bacterial cells use operons to control gene expression. 
	- The portion on the DNA before the gene that will govern whether the DNA is transcribed or not depending on the environment
2. Describe the relationship between the following components of an operon: 
	1. Promoter
		- Attracts the RNA polymerase to the site, before the Operator
	2. Operator
		- The part that is either blocked or unblocked depending on the circumstances
	3. Repressor
		- A protein that binds to the operator to block the transcription of the genetic code
	4. Structural Genes
		- Genes that are necessary for structure or functions in the cell
	5. Regulatory Genes
		- Genes that are necessary to create proteins that will regulate the production or activation of other proteins in the cell
3. Create a t-chart that explains how repressible operons differ from inducible operons.
	- Repressible are active by default and can be turned off, inducible operons are off by default and can be turned on
4. Describe the relationship between these terms and explain how these terms are used to describe eukaryotic gene regulation.
	1. Enhancer
		- A portion of DNA that will bind to the other side of the RNA polymerase, increasing its effectivity
	2. Promoter
		- Portion of DNA before the gene that will attract the RNA polymerase to the site
	3. Silencer
		- A protein that binds to the promoter to disable its promoting functions
	4. DNA
		- The genetic code that is being read and used to produce functional proteins
5. Explain how transcription factors help to regulate eukaryotic gene expression.
	- Presence of an enhancer, silencer, and repressors, activators, as well as activity of the histones
6. Create a t-chart that describes the differences between lytic virus reproduction and lysogenic virus reproduction
	- Lytic: DNA is injected, created quickly until cell explodes with the bacteriophage
	- Lysogenic: DNA is injected and incoporated, multiple cell cycles undergo, there is a chance that the lytic cycle will be activated after each reproduction
7. Describe how the following tools are used to study or modify organismal genomes: 
	1. Restriction Enzymes
		- Cuts open the DNA with some bases left unpaired at the end (Sticky) and will bind to new inserted DNA
	2. Plasmids
		- A small piece of DNA in a circle that has the gene, has an origin of replication, restriction sites, and antibiotic resistence genes, which will be activated in presence of an antibiotic to keep the bacteria alive
	3. Gel Electrophoresis
		- A process that involves putting DNA in a gel and using electricity to move the DNA portions to compare and measure lengths of DNA portions
	4. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
		- Repeated heating (to split DNA) and adding of unpaired bases in order to quickly replicate DNA
