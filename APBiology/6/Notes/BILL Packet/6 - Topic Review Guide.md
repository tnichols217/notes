- Concept 13.2: Many Proteins work together in DNA Replication and Repair pgs. 251-259
	- Power Line: How is genetic information copied for transmission between generations?
		- DNA is condensed into chromosomes, then replicated with DNA polymerase, then it is separated to the two poles of the cell when it splits into two.
		- When it is being passed on into gametes, only one of each gene is passed instead of two to each cell, which then gets recombined with the other parent in order to form a full genome
- Concept 13.3: A chromosome consists of a DNA molecule packed together with proteins pgs. 259-260
	- Power Line: How does the organization of chromosomes impact DNA Replication?
		- It effects how the genes are inherited when going through reproduction, as genes closer to each other on the chromosome are less likely to be recombined, meaning the child will likely have both genes together
- Concept 14.2: Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA - a closer look pgs. 274-276
	- Power Line: What is the importance of the genetic flow from DNA to RNA?
		- DNA stores the information, RNA copies it and makes it ready to be used in the cell
- Concept 14.4: Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of a polypeptide - a closer look pgs. 279-286
	- Power Line: How does translation generate polypeptides that determine genotypes?
		- Polypeptides are the expression of genes, so they are by definition what shows from the genetic code of DNA
- Concept 14.5: Mutations of one or a few nucleotides can affect protein structure and function pgs. 288-290
	- Power Line: How does the various types of mutations impact genotype and phenotype?
		- Mutations can change the genetic code of a gene, changing the resulting protein and therefore the phenotype and genotype if the mutation is sensical
- Figure 15.3: The trp operon in E. coli - regulated synthesis of repressible enzymes pg. 295
	- Power Line: How is the trp operon repressible?
		- When tryptophan is present, the transcription of the gene is turned off
- Figure 15.4: The lac operon in E.coli - regulated synthesis of inducible enzymes pg. 296
	- Power Line: How is the lac operon an inducible?
		- It is off by default, but in the lack of glucose and surplus of lactose, the gene will turn on to digest the lactose
- Figure 15.6: Stages in gene expression that can be regulated in eukaryotic cells pg. 298
	- Power Line: In what ways do eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression?
		- Through histones and repressors/activators

# Recall and Review
  DNA Structure and Replication
1. Explain how the experiments that each of the following people/groups of people performed provided evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
	1. Frederick Griffith
		- Did the killing bateria experiment to prove that dead DNA can be picked up and used (R cells replicating dead S cells)
	2. Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod
		- Remove protein, RNA, and DNA separately to see which mattered in cell division, and proved that DNA was essential
	3. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase
		- Proved that DNA was the carrier of genetic material through experiment with radiolabeled bacteriophages
	4. Erwin Chargaff 
		- Proved A and T, and G and C match in DNA by measuring how much of each are in the DNA
2. Explain what is meant by “antiparallel” orientation of DNA.
	- The two strands of DNA point in opposite directions even though they are bound to each other
3. Describe the four essential functions of the genetic material.  Explain how the structure proposed by Watson and Crick makes these functions possible.
	- Store hereditary information
	- Recombining to produce variation
	- Useful for producing a result (creating proteins)
	- Can be replicated and passed on to inherit information
4. Create a t-chart that compares DNA to RNA.  Include structure, location and function of both molecules in your comparison.
	- DNA double strand, antiparallel, ATCG, nucleolus, makes RNA
	- RNA single strand, AUCG, nucleolus, cytoplasm, makes protein
5. Meselson and Stahl claimed that the replication of DNA was semiconservative.  Describe the evidence they used to support their claim.
	- When radiolabeling DNA and reproducing, each new strand of DNA will have one radiolabeled strand, and when reproducing again, only half of the remaining strains have one strand of radiolabeled DNA
6. Describe what the role of the following enzymes is in DNA replication: 
	1. DNA polymerase
		- makes DNA from DNA
	2. DNA ligase 
		- Patches up the okazaki fragments
	3. DNA primase
		- Gets the DNA polymerase ready to replicated the DNA
7. Explain why the leading strand of DNA is replicated continuously, while the lagging strand is replicated discontinuously.
	- Replication happens in the 5 -> 3 direction, so one strand will be following the strand and one will be going the other direction in chunks
8. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates the differences between the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
	- Prokaryotes have circular DNA and only start from one point, they are also significantly faster
	- Eukaryotes dont have circular DNA and have to take extra precautions for the telomeres, they also replicate at multiple places at once
9. Describe the relationship between the following organizational units of DNA: 
	1. DNA
		- All the genetic info
	2. Nucleosomes
	3. Chromatin
		- The unwound DNA
	4. Chromosome
		- Wound up DNA, ready for replication
	5. Transcription and Translation
		- Reading the DNA to make protein through RNA
10. Compare the processes of DNA replication with transcription.  Be sure to include the following things in your comparison: 
	1. Location of process	
		- Replication in nucleolus while transcription also happens in the same place, but leaves into the cytoplasm
	2. Nucleic acids involved
		- ATCG vs AUCG
	3. Enzymes responsible
		- DNA polymerase vs RNA polymerase, Ribosomes
11. Create a graphic organizer that explains the relationship between the following molecules: 
	1. DNA
		- origin of genetic info
	2. mRNA
		- transcribed DNA
	3. tRNA
		- RNA that connects sequences of mRNA to amino acids
	4. rRNA
		- RNA that folds up into ribosomes in order to facilitate protein production
	5. RNAi
		- RNA that binds to other RNA to prevent it from creating proteins, it eventually breaks down each other
12. Describe the difference between an intron and an exon. 
	- Introns get used to create the final protein, exons do not
13. Eukaryotic mRNA is often modified before it leaves the nucleus. Describe how this happens.
	- Introns are 
14. Explain how the production of eukaryotic mRNA is like watching a tv show that is on Netflix.
15. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates the differences between the processes of transcription and translation, including how they operate in prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes.
16. Explain the relationship between protein synthesis and an organism’s phenotype.
17. Explain how the “one-gene-one protein” hypothesis was derived by Beadle and Tatum.  Why has this hypothesis been refined to “one gene-one polypeptide,” and now “one gene-one (protein) domain?”
  Mutations
18. Create a t-chart that explains the difference between somatic mutations and germline mutations.
19. Create a graphic organizer that illustrates how point mutations differ from chromosomal mutations.  Which one has a greater effect on the organism’s phenotype?

	1. Silent mutation
	2. Missense mutation
	3. Nonsense mutation
	4. Frameshift mutation

22. Explain what would happen to the process of gene expression if the gene for RNA polymerase was mutated.
23. Each amino acid has a tRNA synthetase enzyme that is responsible for attaching it to a tRNA molecule. Explain what would happen if there was a mutation in the gene encoding one of these enzymes.
24. Describe how proteins can be altered once they have been synthesized at the ribosome and what organelles are involved.
