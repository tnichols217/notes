-   Discovery of DNA as the genetic material
    -   Griffith
    -   Hershey-Chase, Avery
    -   Franklin
    -   Chargaff
    -   Watson and Crick
-   Genetic code is universal â€“ what does that mean?
	- Genetic code remains of the same structure across all organisms
-   Structure of DNA
	- Consists of Nucleic Bases, made of the Phosphate backbone and nucleotides
-   Central dogma (DNA -> RNA -> protein)
    -   Names of processes
        - Transcription -> Translation
    -   Descriptions of processes
        - Reads and copys DNA to mRNA, converts mRNA into proteins with help of tRNA
-   mRNA processing in eukaryotes
	- Remove the exons, leaving only the introns, add a sugar hat and A tail
-   Telomeres/telomerase
	- The ends of DNA
-   Mutations
    -   Types and effects
        - Point - switch one base
        - Insertion - inserts a base
        - Deletion - remove a base
        - Frameshift - everything after is changed
        - Missense - Amino acid changed
        - Nonsense - Amino acid changed that modifies the start or end of the protein
-   Differences between transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
	- prokaryotes have circular DNA, and dont do processing on the mRNA
-   Differences between DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
	- circular DNA
-   Control of gene expression in prokaryotes
    -   Lac and trp operons
        - repressed and inducible genes
    -   Inducible versus repressible operons
        - inducible - can be turned on - off by default
        - repressible - can be turned off - on by default
-   Control of gene expression in eukaryotes
    -   Methylating
        - Adding methane groups to the histones
    -   Acetylating
        - Spreading of histones apart to activate DNA
    -   Euchromatin versus heterochromatin
        - Eu - spread out histones, active
        - Hetero - closely packed, inactive
-   Viruses
    -   Lytic versus lysogenic cycle - bacteria replication
        - Lytic - replicate until host cell explodes, killing the host
        - Lysogenic - puts DNA into host cell and lets it reproduce, then explode
    -   Reverse transcription
        - Putting of mRNA back into DNA
-   Biotechnology (purpose, steps)
    -   PCR
        - Split a DNA with heat, the spray bases everywhere and let it bind by itself
    -   Recombinant DNA
        - Combining DNA from two different samples to create new DNA
    -   Electrophoresis
        - Measure similarities in different DNA samples by using electricity and a gel
