-   Discovery of DNA as the genetic material
    -   Griffith
    -   Hershey-Chase, Avery
    -   Franklin
    -   Chargaff
    -   Watson and Crick
-   Genetic code is universal â€“ what does that mean?
	- Genetic code remains of the same structure across all organisms
-   Structure of DNA
	- Consists of Nucleic Bases, made of the Phosphate backbone and nucleotides
-   Central dogma (DNA -> RNA -> protein)
    -   Names of processes
        - Transcription -> Translation
    -   Descriptions of processes
        - Reads and copys DNA to mRNA, converts mRNA into proteins with help of tRNA
-   mRNA processing in eukaryotes
	- Remove the exons, leaving only the introns, add a sugar hat and A tail
-   Telomeres/telomerase
	- The ends of DNA
-   Mutations
    -   Types and effects
        - Point - switch one base
        - Insertion - inserts a base
        - Deletion - remove a base
        - Frameshift - everything after is changed
        - Missense - Amino acid changed
        - Nonsense - Amino acid changed that modifies the start or end of the protein
