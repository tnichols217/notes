1. 1
	- Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter site, then separates the DNA strands
	- Elongaion: RNA strand elongates by zipping down the DNA and creating the RNA strand (in the 5' to 3' direction)
	- Termination: Once the polymerase hits a termination section, it signals that the strand is complete, and depending if it is Rho dependent or not, it either waits for the Rho to come and detach the polymerase, or a hairpin is formed by the RNA binding itself and stalling the polymerase
2. 2
	- Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA
	- Polydenyletion happens, where a poly-A tail is added to the 3' end
	- A cap enzyme is also added to the 5' head
3. 3
	- Initiation: Ribsome binds to the mRNA cap, and find the start codon
	- Elongation: Matching amino acids are added to the polypeptide chain, matching with the codon on the mRNA
	- Once a stop codon is hit, a water molecule is added to the end of the chain and the chain is released from the ribsome as well as the mRNA
4. 4
	- The golgi apparatus may take the protein and further modify it by folding it in different ways to change the function and form of the protein.
	- It may also modify the functional group on the amino acids
	- Phosphylation and Glycosylation may also happen to the protein
