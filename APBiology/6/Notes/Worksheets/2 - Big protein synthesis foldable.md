1. 1
	- Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter site, then separates the DNA strands
	- Elongaion: RNA strand elongates by zipping down the DNA and creating the RNA strand (in the 5' to 3' direction)
	- Termination: Once the polymerase hits a stop codon, it signals that the strand is complete, and depending if it is Rho dependent or not, it either waits for the Rho to come and detach the polymerase,
