1. Explain the structure of the operon in prokaryotes including all key structures. 
2. Explain how an Inducible or Repressible Operon regulates gene expression in prokaryotes including all the molecules involved.  
3. Explain how the role of repressors in the Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes. Include how the absence of lactose or tryptophan affects their operon. 
4. Explain how the function of an operon is similar to feedback inhibition?

- The lac operon consists of a CAP site, Promoter, Operator, and the genes.
- The lac operon is classified as a inducible operon as it is repressed by default. This means that you will need an activator to remove the repressor, which is bound to the operator to block the transcription. The repressor is self regulated, and will be present and bound to the operator if there are no activators present.
- The lac operon uses allolactose as an activator to remove the repressor. Removing the repressor from the operator allows the lac genes to be expressed.

- The regulation loop of the lac operon is similar to a negative feedback loop.
- This regulation allows procaryotes to maintain a certain level of any biological molecule within the cell. In the case of the lac operon, this is the presence of allolactose and the lack of ATP.
- The lac genes produce lactic enzymes, which are able to digest lactose to use as energy, however these genes are
