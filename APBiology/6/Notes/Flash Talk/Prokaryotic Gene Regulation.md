1. Explain the structure of the operon in prokaryotes including all key structures. 
2. Explain how an Inducible or Repressible Operon regulates gene expression in prokaryotes including all the molecules involved.  
3. Explain how the role of repressors in the Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes. Include how the absence of lactose or tryptophan affects their operon. 
4. Explain how the function of an operon is similar to feedback inhibition?

- The lac operon consists of a CAP site, Promoter, Operator, and the genes.
- The RNA polymerase may only bind to the promoter of the operon if the CAP site is occupied with activated CAP. Activated CAP signals low levels of ATP within the cell.
- When a repressor is present on the operator, the RNA polymerase will be unable to pass and therefore cannot express the lac genes.
- The lac operon is classified as a inducible operon as it is repressed by default. This means that you will need an activator to remove the repressor, which is bound to the operator to block the transcription. The repressor is self regulated, and will be present and bound to the operator if there are no activators present.
- The lac operon uses allolactose as an activator to remove the repressor. Removing the repressor from the operator allows the lac genes to be expressed.

- The regulation loop of the lac operon is similar to a negative feedback loop.
- This regulation allows procaryotes to maintain a certain level of any biological molecule within the cell. In the case of the lac operon, this is the presence of allolactose and the lack of ATP.
- The lac genes produce lactic enzymes, which are able to digest lactose to use as energy, however these genes are only transcribed when allolactose is present, and ATP is absent — signalling the need for energy.
- As the lactose content of the cell decreases and ATP increases, this inhibits the further expression of the lac operon, meaning no more lactic enzymes will be produced. And no further lactose will be used and no more ATP will be made.
