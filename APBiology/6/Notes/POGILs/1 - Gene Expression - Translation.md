1. 1
	1. Uracil, Cytosine, Adenine, Guanine, the base on the RNA strand
	2. The amino acid on the chain produced by the bases
	3. The bases are read in triples to produce one amino acid
2. 300 / 3 = 100 - 1 = 99 amino acids (removal of the stop coding region)
3. 3
	1. 4
	2. All start with CC
	3. In case an error in transcription occurs, there is still a higher chance that the correct protein will be made
4. 4
	1. AUG GAA GCC UAC CAG UGA
	2. Met Glu Ala Tyr Gln (stop)
5. Met (AUG)
6. They share a common ancestor or creator
7. 7
	1. Initiation, Elongation, Termination
	2. Starting of the process, Building the chain, Stopping the production
8. Cytoplasm / Ribosomes
9. It is the start codon and begins the chain of amino acids
10. It moves down the mRNA, reading it in triplets
11. 11
	1. GUA
	2. CAU
	3. ✅
	4. CCA
12. It transfers amino acids to the ribosome while matching to the mRNA
13. 2, the previous and current
14. Goes and finds more amino acids
15. Binds water to the end and detaches from the ribosome
16. It creates a chain of amino acids (protein) simply from DNA, through RNA
17. 17
	1. 4x4x4 = 64
	2. 4x4 = 16 (less than 20)
18. UUUUUUUUUUUU => UUCUUUUUUUUU
