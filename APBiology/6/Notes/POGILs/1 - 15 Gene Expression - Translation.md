1. 1
	1. Uracil, Cytosine, Adenine, Guanine, the base on the RNA strand
	2. The amino acid on the chain produced by the bases
	3. The bases are read in triples to produce one amino acid
2. 300 / 3 = 100 - 1 = 99 amino acids (removal of the stop coding region)
3. 3
	1. 4
	2. All start with CC
	3. In case an error in transcription occurs, there is still a higher chance that the correct protein will be made
4. AUG GAA GCC UAC C
