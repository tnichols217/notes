The figure represents the process of expression of gene X in a eukaryotic cell.
1. The primary transcript in the figure is 15 kilobases (kb) long, but the mature mRNA is 7kb in length. Describe the modification that most likely resulted in the 8kb difference in length of the mature mRNA molecule. Identify in your response the location in the cell where the change occurs.
	- The Introns are removed from the sequence, leaving only the exons when RNA processing happens
	- In the Nucleus
2. Predict the length of the mature gene X mRNA if the full-length gene is introduced and expressed in prokaryotic cells. Justify your prediction
	- It would be more than double in length (15kb), as the amount of RNA is also about double, because RNA pre-processing does not often occur in prokaryotic cells
