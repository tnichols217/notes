The figure represents the process of expression of gene X in a eukaryotic cell.
1. The primary transcript in the figure is 15 kilobases (kb) long, but the mature mRNA is 7kb in length. Describe the modification that most likely resulted in the 8kb difference in length of the mature mRNA molecule. Identify in your response the location in the cell where the change occurs.
2. Predict the length of the mature gene X mRNA if the full-length gene is introduced and expressed
