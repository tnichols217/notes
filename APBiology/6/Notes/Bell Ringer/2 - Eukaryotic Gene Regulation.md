The diagrams below represent eukaryotic gene regulation:  the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression by a combination of molecules before, during, and after gene transcription and mRNA translation.  Answer the questions for each diagram below.

>> 1. What is the regulatory role of each of the following:
>> 	1. Histones
>> 		- Keeps DNA untangled and easy to transcribe
>> 	2. Acetylation of Histones
>> 		- Spreads the histones apart from each other, increasing transcription rates
>> 	3. Methylation of Histones
>> 		- Methyl groups bind to tails of the Histones which can spread them apart, increasing transcription rate
>> 	4. Transcription Factors
>> 		- Things required for transcription to be happening, the more there is the more often transcription happens
>> 	5. Enhancer Region / Switch
>> 		- Section of DNA that will increase and increase the probability of binding to a promoter, are more often known as part of the transcription factors
>> 	6. Promoter Region
>> 		- The beginning of the gene, it attracts the RNA polymerase to start at the beginning of the gene expression

>> 1. What is the difference between introns and exons? Which ones are removed during post-transcriptional RNA Splicing?
>> 	- Introns get removed before the RNA gets made into a polypeptide chain
>> 	- Exons are exactly what makes up the polypeptide chain at the end
>> 2. What is the purpose of the 5â€™Cap and the Poly-A Tail?
>> 	- The 5' Cap helps maintain the stability of the RNA strain and protects the strain from falling apart
>> 	- The poly-A tail ensure that whatever transcriber goes through the RNA, there will be enough space at the end to transcribe all the important information
>> 3. One of the post-translational modifications is degradation of protein.  How could this relate to cell signaling? 
>> 	-  Allows stagnant signals to be removed after some time and return to normal levels within the cell
