The diagrams below represent eukaryotic gene regulation:  the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression by a combination of molecules before, during, and after gene transcription and mRNA translation.  Answer the questions for each diagram below.

### Regulation of Transcription

1. What is the regulatory role of each of the following:
	1. Histones
		- Keeps DNA untangled and easy to transcribe
	2. Acetylation of Histones
		- Spreads the histones apart from each other, increasing transcription rates
	3. Methylation of Histones
		- Methyl groups bind to tails of the Histones which can spread them apart, increasing transcription rate
	4. Transcription Factors
		- Things required for transcription to be happening, the more there is the more often transcription happens
	5. Enhancer Region / Switch
		- Section of DNA that will increase and increase the probability of binding to a promoter, are more often known as part of the transcription factors
	6. Promoter Region
		- The beginning of the gene, it attracts the RNA polymerase to start at the beginning of the gene expression

### Post-Transcriptional and Translational Regulation

1. What is the difference between introns and exons? Which ones are removed during post-transcriptional RNA Splicing?
	- Introns get removed before the RNA gets made into a polypeptide chain
	- Exons are exactly what makes up the polypeptide chain at the end
2. What is the purpose of the 5’Cap and the Poly-A Tail?
	- The 5' Cap helps maintain the stability of the RNA strain and protects the strain from falling apart
	- The poly-A tail ensure that whatever transcriber goes through the RNA, there will be enough space at the end to transcribe all the important information
3. One of the post-translational modifications is degradation of protein.  How could this relate to cell signaling? 
	-  Allows stagnant signals to be removed after some time and return to normal levels within the cell
