The diagrams below represent operons, clusters of genes that control gene expression in bacteria. Answer the questions for each diagram below.

1. What is the role of each of the following:
	1. Regulatory gene:
		- The gene that codes for repressors / activators of other genes
	2. RNA polymerase:
		- Reads the DNA and transcribes it into RNA for it to be made into a protein
	3. Promoter:
		- The site before a gene that attracts the RNA polymerase to bind and transcribe the DNA
	4. Operator:
		- The part after the promoter, but before the gene code that will either block or allow the RNA polymerase to pass, it can be activated or deactivated by regulatory proteins
	5. Repressor:
		- The protein that will bind to the operator to block the RNA polymerase

2. What is the effect of the inducer on the repressor? Why is it called an inducer?
	- The inducer malforms the active site of the repressor, deactivating the repressor and removing it from the operator
3. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.
	- This is a inducible operon, as the repressor is bound to the operator by default, and only deactivated when the inducer is present

4. Examine the diagram of the trp operon at left. How is it similar to the diagram of the lac operon above?
	- It has a repressor, promoter, and operator
5. Why do you think it is called a corepressor? What is the effect of the corepressor on gene expression?
	- Because both the repressor and the corepressor need to be present to actually repress the gene
6. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.
	- Repressible, as it is on by default, but only blocked when two proteins are present
