>> 1. What is the role of each of the following:
>> 	1. Regulatory gene:
>> 		- The gene that codes for repressors / activators of other genes
>> 	2. RNA polymerase:
>> 		- Reads the DNA and transcribes it into RNA for it to be made into a protein
>> 	3. Promoter:
>> 		- The site before a gene that attracts the RNA polymerase to bind and transcribe the DNA
>> 	4. Operator:
>> 		- The part after the promoter, but before the gene code that will either block or allow the RNA polymerase to pass, it can be activated or deactivated by regulatory proteins
>> 	5. Repressor:
>> 		- The protein that will bind to the operator to block the RNA polymerase

>> 2. What is the effect of the inducer on the repressor? Why is it called an inducer?
>>	- The inducer malforms the active site of the repressor, deactivating the repressor and removing it from the operator
>> 3. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.
>> 	- This is a repressible operon, as the repressor is bound to the operator by default, and only deactivated when the inducer is present

>> 4. Examine the diagram of the trp operon at left. How is it similar to the diagram of the lac operon above?
>> 	- It has a repressor, promoter, and operator
>> 5. Why do you think it is called a corepressor? What is the effect of the corepressor on gene expression?
>> 	- Because both the
>> 6. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.
