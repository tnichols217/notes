The diagrams below represent **operons**, clusters of genes that control gene expression in bacteria. Answer the questions for each diagram below.

1. What is the role of each of the following:
	1. Regulatory gene:
	2. RNA polymerase:
	3. Promoter:
	4. Operator:
	5. Repressor:
2. What is the effect of the inducer on the repressor? Why is it called an inducer?
3. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? **Justify** your answer.
4. Examine the diagram of the trp operon at left. How is it similar to the diagram of the lac operon above?
5. Why do you think it is called a corepressor? What is the effect of the corepressor on gene expression?
6. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? **Justify** your answer.
