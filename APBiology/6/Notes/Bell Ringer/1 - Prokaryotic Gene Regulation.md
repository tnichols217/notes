**Bellringer:** Prokaryotic Gene Regulation

AP Biology

The diagrams below represent **operons**, clusters of genes that control gene expression in bacteria. Answer the questions for each diagram below.

 

What is the role of each of the following:

  

Regulatory gene:

  

RNA polymerase:

  

Promoter:

  

Operator:

  

Repressor:

What is the effect of the inducer on the repressor? Why is it called an inducer?

Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? **Justify** your answer.

Examine the diagram of the trp operon at left. How is it similar to the diagram of the lac operon above?

Why do you think it is called a corepressor? What is the effect of the corepressor on gene expression?

Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? **Justify** your answer.
