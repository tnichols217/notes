   What is the role of each of the following:
	1. Regulatory gene:
		- The gene that codes for repressors / activators of other genes
	2. RNA polymerase:
		- Reads the DNA and transcribes it into RNA for it to be made into a protein
	3. Promoter:
		- The site before a gene that attracts the RNA poly
	4. Operator:
	5. Repressor:

   What is the effect of the inducer on the repressor? Why is it called an inducer?
3. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.

   Examine the diagram of the trp operon at left. How is it similar to the diagram of the lac operon above?
5. Why do you think it is called a corepressor? What is the effect of the corepressor on gene expression?
6. Is this an inducible or a repressible operon? Justify your answer.
