## Questions
1. The Gene expression differs greatly between the HFF and iPS cells.
	- For example in the SOX2-KLF4 genes, the iPS cells display significantly more gene expression than the HFF cells
	- The exact opposite can be seen in the COL1A2-TSLP genes, and they appear to be roughly similar on the GAPDH-CDK1 genes
2. Look at the graph, Red gr
