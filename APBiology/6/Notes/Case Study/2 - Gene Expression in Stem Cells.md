## Questions
1. The Gene expression differs greatly between the HFF and iPS cells.
	- For example in the SOX2-KLF4 genes, the iPS cells display significantly more gene expression than the HFF cells
	- The exact opposite can be seen in the COL1A2-TSLP genes, and they appear to be roughly similar on the GAPDH-CDK1 genes
2. Look at the graph, red bar much bigger, then blue bar big, then same
3. This supports my claim that environmental factors in development effect the expression of genes. Since iPS and HFF cells were probably made for different purposes (and through different methods) it is unlikely that they express the same genes, and this data agrees with that.
4. What cells display similar traits to that of the iPS cells? Is it possible to manufacture a cell with similar gene expression to that of the HFF cell?
