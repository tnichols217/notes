1. They created an accurate model of DNA from the X-ray data from Franklin Rosalind
2. Because DNA is what holds all the information to code for life forms - the language of living things
3. To understand how DNA would code for genes which would effect living forms. It also allows for a deeper understanding of inheritance
4. With enough research we could probably synthesize our own DNA and modify life forms
5. Radiolabeled sulfur in the proteins did not show up in the children bacteriophage, while the radiolabeled phosphorus in DNA did show up in the children. 
6. Building a simulation to simulate how it would behave virtually. We can solve for the components of a molecule based on it its properties.
7.
