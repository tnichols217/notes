1. They created an accurate model of DNA from the X-ray data from Franklin Rosalind
2. Because DNA is what holds all the information to code for life forms - the language of living things
3. To understand how DNA would code for genes which would effect living forms. It also allows for a deeper understanding of inheritance
4. With enough research we could probably synthesize our own DNA and modify life forms
5. Radiolabeled sulfur in the proteins did not show up in the children bacteriophage, while the radiolabeled phosphorus in DNA did show up in the children. 
6. Building a simulation to simulate how it would behave virtually. We can solve for the components of a molecule based on it its properties.
7. Shooting X-ray beams through molecules and measuring the diffraction or reflection of such beams to gain an understanding of the shape of a molecule. X-rays' wavelength is roughly the distance between the atoms, which would give a good enough resolution to model the locations of the atoms
8. Imagine taking a picture of something, you can see it
9. Both are useful for understanding different aspects of the molecule. A simulation would give greater understanding of more than just the shape of it, but would require more computational time. 
10. Two polyneucleotides that coil around each other to form a double helix. It also consists of deoxyribose sugar, nitrogeneous base, and phosphate groups
11. A-T C-G
12. It describes the ratio between the different bases in the cell
13. It is helical in shape indicated by the cross in the photo. They also figured out that the bases stack and the phosphate is on the outside
14. It was the 51st photo and it was taken by rosalind franklin
15. Yes, it offered great insight into what it was long before anyone else was looking into it.
