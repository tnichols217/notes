## Questions
1. To facilitate the uptake of DNA that contains a gene of interest
2. Red fluorescent protein
3. 3
	1. Ori: The origin of the replication
	2. pBAD promoter and araC genes regulate the rfp production
	3. ampR indentifies transformed bacteria
4. Able to bind to specific DNA in its environment
5. It makes the membrane more permeable for the DNA to enter
6. It neutralizes negatively charged DNA, allowing the cells to be competent
7. 7
	1. Luria Broth solution: Growth medium containing biological macromolecules necessary for growth
	2. pARA-R solution: Solution with recombinant pARA-R plasmids (with the rfp gene)
	3. Competent cells: Tube with prepared cells ready to accept DNA
8. Tube 4
9.  Control group is the current standard way of producing the result (if done before) to be used as a reference and comparison point to the new method
10. Negative Control group is when all the necessary preparations are done to the investigative group, but no treatment is actually administered, it is expected to show no results
11. The experimental group is the group with the new treatment, and is used to see how different things produce different results to be compared with the controls
12. Tube 2, as no treatment (plasmids) were administered to the solution
13. -
14. -
15. Yes, the P- tube had no plasmids so it did not show any effect, and the P+ tube did
16. Compare it to the controls and see how the results differ
17. -

## Reflection
1. A process where external DNA is merged with competent cells in order to replicate the DNA and possibly proteins
2. P- doesnt have the recombinant plasmid, and P+ does
3. True
4. To prevent the test groups to contaminate each other or the environment from contaminating the test groups
5. Because the membranes will be more permeable to the recombinant plasmids
