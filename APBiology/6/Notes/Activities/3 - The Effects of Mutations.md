1. 1
2. 2
3. Everything after the second codon is different


1. 1
	1. A molecule that plays a part in controlling cell division
	2. Mice used for testing
2. Frameshit, caused by addition or deletion because it modifies every amino acid after it
3. Skeletal muscle of mammals
4. Is a growth factor in muscle cells
5. It could be an insertion or deletion, I cant tell, but it does cause frameshift, because since the incident all the amino acids are changed
6. Frameshit
7. Missense, because it modifies the amino acid strain without completely breaking it
8. It may be more effective at promoting growth in the cells or possibly is a broken cell growth inhibitor

# Hemoglobin
## Normal Hemoglobin
DNA: CAC GTG GAC TGA GGA CTC CTC
mRNA: GUG CAC CUG ACU CCU GAG GAG
Amino Acid: Val His Leu Thr Pro Glu Glu

## Mutated Hemoglobin
DNA: CAC GTG GAC TGA GGA CAC CTC
mRNA: GUG CAC CUG ACU CCU GUG GAG
Amino Acid: Val His Leu Thr Pro Val Glu

9. Red Blood Cell malformation
10. Missense, because no start/stop codons were modified
11. Because it gives them an advantage at surviving
