## Key:
***Positive***
*Negative*
**Polar**
Nonpolar

## Hb-b
DNA: CAC ***GTG*** GAC **TGA** GGA *CTC* *CTC*
mRNA: GUG ***CAC*** CUG **ACU** CCU *GAG* *GAG*
Amino Acid: val ***his*** leu **thr** pro *glu* *glu*

## Hb-s
DNA: CAC ***GTG*** GAC **TGA** GGA CAC *CTC*
mRNA: GUG ***CAC*** CUG **ACU** CCU GUG *GAG*
Amino Acid: val ***his*** leu **thr** pro val *glu*

1. 3
	1. Hb-s's second last codon changed from *glu (Negative)* to val (Nonpolar)
	2. The interactions between the R-groups of the amino acids making up this protein will change and cause the shape of the protein to differ
	3. The shape will be different and malformed, possibly preventing the protein from executing its purpose

# Check your Hypothesis
1. Makes it sickle shaped (malformed)
2. It is the same, malshapen
3. Its the SAME
