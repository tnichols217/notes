### Visualizing transcription
1. 1
2. 2
	1. A gene is section of DNA that when read will produce proteins which will effect the functional or physical attributes of the cell/organism
	2. mRNA
	3. Uracil (U)
	4. Nucleolus

### Mechanics of transcription
1. 1
2. mRNA is made from DNA (after unzipped), mRNA leaves cell, gets processed then goes to the ribsomes where proteins are formed from amino acids with the help of tRNA.

### Practicing transcription
1. 1
	1. DNA: `TACGGGTTAAAAATCCCGCTACAGGCTTCCGTA`
	2. mRNA: `AUGCCCAAUUUUUAGGGCGAUGUCCGAAGGCAU`
2. 2
	1. DNA: `TACAGGAGAAAATAAGACCGAAGCTGCTCAATT`
	2. mRNA: `AUGUCCUCUUUUAUUCUGGCUUCGACGAGUUAA`
3. 3
	1. DNA: `TACTTTTGGAGAGAGGGCTCGCATAATTTCCGA`
	2. mRNA: `AUGAAAACCUCUCUCCCGAGCGUAUUAAAGGCU`
