# Water
## Four emergent properties of water
1. Cohesion and Adhesion
2. High heat Capacity
3. Surface Tension: polar and dissolves other polar bonds
4. Expands when freezes

## PH
Low PH => More Hydrogen atoms => Hydronium => Acidic
High PH => Less Hydrogen atoms => Hydroxide => Basic
**$-log[\text{ Concentration of Hydronium }]$**
> [!def] Buffers
> A solution that is resistant to PH change
