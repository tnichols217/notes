1. 1
	1. Exothermic and Endothermic
	2. $\Delta H$
	3. -
2. 2
	1. Endothermic
	2. Endothermic
	3. Endothermic
3. No, water -> ice above $0\degree C$ 
4. 4
	1. $\Delta S$
	2. +
5. No, they aren't correlated
6. 6
	1. Increasing
	2. Decreasing
	3. Increasing
7. 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1
8. Yes, Increasing -> Reactants, Decreasing -> Products
9. 9
	1. Increasing
	2. Decreasing
	3. Decreasing
	4. Increasing
10. Yes most of the time, but it also depends on temperature for cooling and heating
11. It heats up
12. Decreasing
13. Increasing
14. 14
	1. A, B, C, D
	2. H, below $60\degree C$
	3. G, below $0\degree C$
15. 15
	1. -
	2. +
	3. because $\Delta H$ is negative and subtracting a positive $T\Delta S$ will always result in a negative (Exergonic)
16. $\Delta H > 0$ and $\Delta S < 0$ so $\Delta H - T\Delta S > 0$, meaning it is Endergonic (non-spontaneous)
 Issues QG17. Because even if $\Delta H = 0$, $T\Delta S > 0$, making $\Delta G < 0$ 

17. 18
	1. Decreasing
	2. Increasing
	3. System
18. 19
	1. The fire, because it produces heat
	2. The water because it absorbs the energy
