| **Pepsin** | **1.5** |
| ---------- | ------- |
| **Lipase** | **8**   |

4. No Lipase, but maximum Pepsin
5. No Pepsin, but maximum Lipase
6. It becomes denatured and malshaped
7. 8, because it is the highest reaction rate
8. 1.5, because it is its peak reaction rate
9. No, since the pH levels are vastly different, the overall shape of the protein will also be vastly different

11. Decreases its effectivity as Pepsin works best at lower pH levels, and at 6-7 there is very little effectivity
12. 12
	1. Amylase is most effective at 40 degrees, and decreases when moved away from 40 degrees
	2. More enzyme concentration leads to more r.r. in a linear manner
	3. More substrate concentration leads to higher reaction in a logarithmic pattern
13. 13
	1. 40 degrees
	2. In order for it to function well, you'll need to maintain homeostasis at this temperature to maximise effectivity, too high and itll damage the enzyme, too little and the molecules will move too slowly
14. The molecules move slower, so they interact with the enzymes less frequently, slowing down the reaction
15. Since his temperature is closer to the peak rate of reaction for amylase, he will digest carbs faster since the carbs are interacting with the amylase more often due to the faster speeds of the molecules.

	1. Linearly increasing, directly related
	2. More enzyme means more faster
