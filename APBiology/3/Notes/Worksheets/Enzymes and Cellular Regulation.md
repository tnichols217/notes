1. Pepsin and Lipase

	1. The stomach
	2. Small Intestine

   | **Pepsin** | **1.5** |
   | ---------- | ------- |
   | **Lipase** | **8**   |
4. No Lipase, but maximum Pepsin
5. No Pepsin, but maximum Lipase
6. It becomes denatured and malshaped
7. 8, because it is the highest reaction rate
8. 1.5, because it is its peak reaction rate
9. No, since the pH levels are vastly different, the overall shape of the protein will also be vastly different

11. Decreases its effectivity as Pepsin works best at lower pH levels, and at 6-7 there is very little effectivity
12. 12
	1. Amylase is most effective at 40 degrees, and decreases when moved away from 40 degrees
	2. More enzyme concentration leads to more r.r. in a linear manner
	3. More substrate concentration leads to higher reaction in a logari
