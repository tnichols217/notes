    | **Pepsin** | **1.5** |
    | ---------- | ------- |
    | **Lipase** | **8**   |
4. No Lipase, but maximum Pepsin
5. No Pepsin, but maximum Lipase
6. It becomes denatured and malshaped
7. 8, because it is the highest reaction rate
8. 1.5, because it is its peak reaction rate
9. No, since the pH levels are vastly different, the overall shape of the protein will also be vastly different

11. Decreases its effectivity as Pepsin works best at lower pH levels, and at 6-7 there is very little effectivity

	1. Amylase is most effective at 40 degrees, and decreases when moved away from 40 degrees
	2. More enzyme concentration leads to more r.r. in a linear manner
	3. More substrate concentration leads to higher reaction in a logarithmic pattern
13. 13
	1. 40 degrees
	2. In order for it to function well, you'll need to maintain homeostasis at this temperature to maximise effectivity, too high and itll damage the enzyme, too little and the molecules will move too slowly
14. The molecules move slower, so they interact with the enzymes less frequently, slowing down the reaction
15. Since his temperature is closer to the peak rate of reaction for amylase, he will digest carbs faster since the carbs are interacting with the amylase more often due to the faster speeds of the molecules.

	1. Linearly increasing, directly related
	2. More enzyme means more faster
17. Respiration produces around 32 to 42 ATP, while fermentation only produces 2 ATP
18. No NAD would be reproduced, and eventually there would not be any NAD to carry any electrons, stopping other functions like glycolysis. Converting the NADH to NAD is important for reusing the NAD, otherwise new NAD would have to be created, which would use more energy than it produces.
19. Since strenuous exercise happens faster than you can supply oxygen for, this forces your muscle cells to break down glucose via fermentation instead of full respiration. The lack of oxygen leads to fermentation which leads to a lactic acid buildup.
20. Oxygen enabled organisms are able to respirate, which is multiple times better at breaking down energy from glucose (about 18x better), this allows them to be more efficient, needing less sugar as food.
