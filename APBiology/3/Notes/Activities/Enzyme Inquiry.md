1. The things that are the inputs to the reaction, they get acted upon
2. The chemical change or reaction
3. The Products
4. Substrates
5. Bind to the enzyme
6. Eject the products
7. The shape of the active site
8. Its what the reactants bind to, it matches the reactants it acts upon
9. The charges are the same, so they repel each other
10. The shapes don't match, so the reactant can't bind to the enzyme
11. Shape and charge
12. Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reaction
13. The chemical reaction won't happen
14. Lowers the activation energy
15. Protein, amino acids
16. polarity and charge
