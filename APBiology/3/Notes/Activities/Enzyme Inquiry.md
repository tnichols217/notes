1. The things that are the inputs to the reaction, they get acted upon
2. The chemical change or reaction
3. The Products
4. Substrates
5. Bind to the enzyme
6. Eject the products
7. The shape of the active site
8. Its what the reactants bind to, it matches the reactants it acts upon
9. The charges are the same, so they repel each other
10. The shapes don't match, so the reactant can't bind to the enzyme
11. Shape and charge
12. Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reaction
13. The chemical reaction won't happen
14. Lowers the activation energy
15. Protein, amino acids
16. polarity and charge
17. Interactions between different R groups
18. Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, disulfide bridges, and ionic bonds
19. Increases steadily until optimum temperature then plummets down
20. The temperature of highest enzyme activity level
21. It plummets quickly
22. The active site is deformed
23. Enzymes get denatured when out of its operating temperature/pH
24. deform or die
25. Interactions between the R-groups of the amino acids no longer conform to its correct shape. This leads the protein structure to change completely
26. False, cold does not denature an enzyme, it just slows down the molecules
27. Denaturization is sometimes reversible
28. 0-7 are acidic
29. 7-14 are basic
30. 7, the pH of pure water
31. 3 pH
32. 9 pH
33. Completely useless, it cannot operate at all
34. 7, it is much lower than its optimum rate, but it still functions
35. It competes against the substrates of the enzyme, it competes for the active site, occupying it so that no reaction can take place
36. The normal reactants cannot bind, and so no reaction occurs
37. It does not compete for the active site, but just deforms it
38. It irreversibly deforms the active site of an enzyme, stopping production
39. 1
40. 3
41. 4
42. 4
43. All the enzymes are in maximum use, so adding more subtrates would not increase the speed
44. More enzyme
45. The enzyme concentration stays constant, but the substrate and products are inversely related. As the substrate decreases the product increases proportionally.
46. There is no more
