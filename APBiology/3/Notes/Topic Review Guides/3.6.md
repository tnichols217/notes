1. Growth, muscle contraction, storage of energy
2. ![[Pasted image 20221119212711.png]]
3. Break down glucose into something the mitochondria can handle
4. Completely obliterated and turned into pure energy
5. NADH, FADH, ATP
6. Get attached to electron carriers and put down the ETC later
7. There is no oxygen, so aerobic respiration cannot happen, so fermentation takes place to produce energy when there is no oxygen
8. The last inorganic phosphate group (Pi) from ATP gets released, releasing energy
9. Convert other electron carriers into ATP
10. Carry electrons to the ETC when ATP cannot be made directly due to different available molecules
11. The krebs cycle needs the oxygen to bind to the released carbon, to create carbon dioxide
12. Convert other electron carriers into ATP by creating a proton gradient and using chemiosmosis (through the ATP synthase) to make ATP
13. Formation of ATP from ADP, after the krebs cycle
14. It uses a gradient of something to do something
15. I've never heard of decoupling in respiration
