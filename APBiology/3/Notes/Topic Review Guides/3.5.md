1. $H_2O$ + $CO_2$ + light => $C_6H_{12}O_6$ + $O_2$
2. electrons get excited and used to pump hydrogen ions against the concentration gradient and bind to electron carriers
3. They absorb light to excite electrons, which is the energy harnessed to do work
4. An electron gets excited
5. The chlorophyll
6. 6
	1. Light hits the chlorophyll
	2. electron gets excited
	3. electron is replaced by hydrolysis
	4. ETC pumps proton into membrane
	5. ATP is produced from the gradient
	6. Light hits chlorophyll and excites electron
	7. Electron moves to the
