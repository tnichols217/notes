1. $H_2O$ + $CO_2$ + light => $C_6H_{12}O_6$ + $O_2$
2. electrons get excited and used to pump hydrogen ions against the concentration gradient and bind to electron carriers
3. They absorb light to excite electrons, which is the energy harnessed to do work
4. An electron gets excited
5. The chlorophyll
6. 6
	1. Light hits the chlorophyll
	2. electron gets excited
	3. electron is replaced by hydrolysis
	4. ETC pumps proton into membrane
	5. ATP is produced from the gradient
	6. Light hits chlorophyll and excites electron
	7. Electron moves to the edge of the membrane
	8. Electron is used to bind to an electron carrier
7. 7
	1. Get made for use later
	2. Used as stored energy to perform functions in the light-independent cycle
8. Both functionally do the same thing, use the energy of an electron to pump hydrogen, but the source of the electron is different and where the electrons end up are different
9. From the light dependent reactions, in the form of ATP and NADPH
