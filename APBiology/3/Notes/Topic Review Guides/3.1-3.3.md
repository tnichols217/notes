2. The enzyme has an active site that fits the shape, polarity, and charge of a specific substrate. This specificity only allows specific molecules to bind to it, its substrates and blockers
3. Enzymes lower the activation energy for a specific chemical reaction, allowing them to happen faster
4. Denaturing is when a protein can no longer perform its function due to a misshaping caused by overheat, or inadequate pH levels
5. Denaturing an enzyme means that its active site will be the wrong shape, meaning that its substrates cannot bind to it
6. pH is defined by the inverse concentration of hydrogen ions in a specific solution, an increase of hydrogen ions leads to higher acidity and a positive charge in the solution, which could deform denature enzymes
7. Higher temperatures lead to faster moving molecules which leads to a higher chance that an enzyme will collide with its substrates over time, although at a certain temperature, the enzymes would be denatured from the temperature can will no longer function
8. Higher substrate concentration leads to a higher enzyme activity and reaction rate because more substrates will be bumping into enzymes over time, until the saturation of enzymes happens, when the reaction rate will significantly reduce because now increasing the substrate concentration will only minisculy increase the chances that substrates will bump into an unoccupied enzyme
9. Higher enzyme concentration positively linearly maps to an increase in enzyme activity
10. Increase in temperature can only increase the rate so much, until it kills the enzymes. Increase in the concentration of substates would only increase the reaction rate until saturation of the enzymes. This would be the maximum speed of the enzyme
11. Both stop substrates from binding to the enzyme, although allosteric would permanently disable the enzyme from functioning, and is more effective at stopping a reaction, while competitive inhibitors are only as functional as the concentration of the inhibitor, and they don't stay permanently bound to the enzyme
