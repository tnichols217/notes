2. The enzyme has an active site that fits the shape, polarity, and charge of a specific substrate. This specificity only allows specific molecules to bind to it, its substrates and blockers
3. Enzymes lower the activation energy for a specific chemical reaction, allowing them to happen faster
4. Denaturing is when a protein can no longer perform its function due to a misshaping caused by overheat, or inadequate pH levels
5. Denaturing an enzyme means that its active site will be the wrong shape, meaning that its substrates cannot bind to it
6. pH is defined by the inverse concentration of hydrogen ions in a specific solution, an increase of hydrogen ions leads to higher acidity and a positive charge in the solution, which could deform denature enzymes
7. Higher temperatures lead to faster moving molecules which leads to a higher chance that an enzyme will collide with its substrates over time, although at a certain temperature, the enzymes would be denatured from the temperature can will no longer function
8. Higher substrate concentration leads to a higher enzyme activity and reaction rate because more substrates will be bumping into enzymes over time, un
