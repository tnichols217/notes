2. The enzyme has an active site that fits the shape, polarity, and charge of a specific substrate. This specificity only allows specific molecules to bind to it, its substrates and blockers
3. Enzymes lower the activation energy for a specific chemical reaction, allowing them to happen faster
4. Denaturing is when a protein can no longer perform its function due to a mishaping caused by
