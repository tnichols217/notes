	1. The Intermembrane Space
	2. Active pumping out from the Mitochondrial Matrix
3. It is going against the concentration gradient

6. No
7. No
8. Along with the concentration gradient, facilitated diffusion
9. No, it is going with the gradient so it is lowering its potential energy
10. ATP Synthase
11. The production of ATP with ATP Synthase
12. ADP
