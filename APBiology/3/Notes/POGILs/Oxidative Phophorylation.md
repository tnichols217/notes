6. No
7. No
8. Along with the concentration gradient, facilitated diffusion
9. No, it is going with the gradient so it is lowering its potential energy
10. ATP Synthase
11. The production of ATP with ATP Synthase
12. ADP

17. Oxidative phosphorylation is used to produce ATP from ADP in chemiosmosis. Substrate level phosphorylation is used in glycolysis and krebs cycle.
18. The intermembrane space, as it has a high concentration of protons
19. No energy will be able to be produced and the cell will die
