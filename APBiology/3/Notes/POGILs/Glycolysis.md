	2. 2
3. Yes, it takes two ATP, but produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH
4. It has the most potential energy (has the most bonds)
5. Less, it has less bonds and the process to get from glucose to pyruvate produces usable chemical energy
6. 2ATP
7. NAD+
8. From the previous molecule, which got the Pi from the first two ATP
9. Mitochondrion
10. 10
	1. No, pyruvate is a large polar molecule, meaning it probably would not fit through the membrane
	2. With a facilitated transport protein it could be diffused across the membrane
11. A carbon dioxide molecule
