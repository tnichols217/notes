	1. Glucose
	2. 6

	1. 3
	2. 2
3. Yes, it takes two ATP, but produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH
4. It has the most potential energy (has the most bonds)
5. Less, it has less bonds and the process to get from glucose to pyruvate produces usable chemical energy
6. 2ATP
7. NAD+
8. From the previous molecule, which got the Pi from the first two ATP
9. Mitochondrion
10. 10
	1. No, pyruvate is a large polar molecule, meaning it probably would not fit through the membrane
	2. With a facilitated transport protein it could be diffused across the membrane
11. A carbon dioxide molecule
12. 12
	1. Pyrivate Oxydase
	2. 2
	3. Acetyl CoA
	4. Has a single bond with the Carbon backbone
13. 0
14. 1 NADH
15. 2 Acetyl CoA, 2 $CO_2$, 2 NADH
16. Inside the mitochondrial matrix
17. Acetyl-CoA
18. Not directly
19. 19
	1. 4

	3. The acetyl-CoA
20. 20
	1. 5
	2. The creation of a $CO_2$
21. 21
	1. 4
	2. The creation of a $CO_2$
22. 3 NADH, 1 ATP, 1 FADH
23. Citrate, it has the most bonds and releases a lot of energy without needing to bond with something else
24. Oxaloacetate, it cannot release any high energy molecules without getting bonds from the Acetyl CoA
25. The Acetyl CoA carries an acetyl group, which is high energy because it fuels the Krebs cycle to produce all the higher energy molecules
26. 2
27. 4 $CO_2$, 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 $FADH_2$
28. No
29. Citrate to $\alpha$-Ketoglutenase, the main molecule loses free energy, but going from NAD to NADH increases free enrgy
30. 30
	1. Pyruvate, Glucose, and Acetyl CoA
	2. A fat molecule would be able to store many times more energy as it has more bonds and could possibly break down into multiple glucose molecules
	3. Muscles, Heart, Brain
