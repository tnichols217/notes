3. Yes, it takes two ATP, but produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH
4. It has the most potential energy (has the most bonds)
5. Less, it has less bonds and the process to get from glucose to pyruvate produces usable chemical energy
6. 2ATP
7. NAD+
8. From the previous molecule, which got the Pi from the first two ATP
9. Mitochondrion
