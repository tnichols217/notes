1. 1
	1. Exothermic and Endothermic
	2. $\Delta H$
	3. -
2. 2
	1. Endothermic
	2. Endothermic
	3. Endothermic
3. No, water -> ice above $0\degree C$ 
4. 4
	1. $\Delta S$
	2. +
5. No, they aren't correlated
6. 6
	1. Increasing
	2. Decreasing
	3. Increasing
7. 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1
8. Yes, Increasing -> Reactants, Decreasing -> Products
9. 9
	1. Increasing
	2. Decreasing
	3. Decreasing
	4. Increasing
10. Yes most of the time, but it also depends on temperature for cooling and heating
11. It heats up
12. Decreasing
13. Increasing
14. 14
	1. A, B, C, D
	2. H, below $60\degree C$
	3. G, below $0\degree C$
15. 15
	1. -
	2. +
16. because $\Delta H$ is negative and subtracting a positive $T\Delta S$ will always result in a negative (Exergonic)
17. $\Delta H > 0$ and $\Delta S < 0$ so $\Delta H - T\Delta S > 0$, meaning it is Endergonic (non-spontaneous)
 Issues QG17. Because even if $\Delta H = 0$, $T\Delta S > 0$, making $\Delta G < 0$ 
18. 18
	1. Decreasing
	2. Increasing
	3. System
19. 19
	1. The fire, because it produces heat
	2. The water because it absorbs the energy
20. 20
	1. The breaking of Glucose, it breaks bonds, making energy
	2. Production of ATP, it uses energy to make bonds
21. No, exothermic releases heat, but exergonic releases energy, but not heat
22. 22
	1. Entropy will continue to increase and more energy will be neeeded
	2. The sun.
23. No, spontaneous means that it increases the total entropy in the universe. If it doesnt, then its not spontaneous. 

# ATP
1. In order of left to right: Adenine, ribose sugar, phosphate group
2. 2
	1. There are three phosphate groups
	2. Take away the third phosphate group
3. ATP + $H_2O$ => ADP + Phosphate group
4. Split into $OH$ and $O$
5. Hydro = water, lysis = break / cut, it breaks the $H_2O$ into $OH$ and $O$
6. 6
	1. Net output, as it breaks bonds
	2. ATP, it has more bonds
7. 7
	1. Exothermic, it releases energy
	2. Its the breaking of water that releases energy
8. 8
	1. ADP + Phosphate group + Energy => ATP + Water
	2. It adds the phosphate group back to the ADP
	3. Endergonic, it absorbs energy
9. Left: Phosphorylation, Right: Hydrolysis
10. 10
	1. Cellular processes
	2. Formation of glucose or fats
11. Respiration
12. 12
	1. Forming ATP through phosphorelation
	2. Spending ATP to make ADP
	3. Saving ATP (energy) for later
13. $\text{Adenosine}-\text{Nitrogenous Base}-\text{Phosphate Group}$
14. Exergonic, it releases energy
15. It prevents the body from producing new ATP through electron transfer so that it would break down sugars (weight) to produce energyPhotosynthesis
