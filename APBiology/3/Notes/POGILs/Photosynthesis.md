	2. Two or Six depending on how you count it
	3. 18 ATP and 12 NADPH
26. Back to be reused in other cellular processes, such as photosynthesis again
27. Light depenent creates ATP and other electron carriers essential to the light indepenent reactions, which produce glucose and and recycle the electron carriers
