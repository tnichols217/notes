14. No
15. 15
	1. $2H_2O$ + Light + $2NADP^+$ + $3ADP$ => $2NADPH$ + $O_2$ + $3ATP$

20. Exited the cycle in PGAL
21. Adds the carbon from carbon dioxide to the cycle
22. 22
	1. PGAL
	2. The Oxygen on the end is swapped for Hydrogen
	3. 6 ATP and 6 NADPH
	4. No, 6 PGA and 6 PGAL both have 3 carbons each
23. 23
	1. 6

	3. 15
	4. RuBP
	5. 3
	6. Goes off to produce Glucose and other biomolecules
25. 25
	1. Two, one PGAL has 3 Carbons and Glucose has 6
	2. Two or Six depending on how you count it
	3. 18 ATP and 12 NADPH
26. Back to be reused in other cellular processes, such as photosynthesis again
27. Light depenent creates ATP and other electron carriers essential to the light indepenent reactions, which produce glucose and and recycle the electron carriers
28. 28
    
    | $6CO_2$   | $12H_2O$  | ->  | $C_6H_{12}O_6$ | $6O_2$        | $6H_2O$       |
    | --------- | --------- | --- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | LD (used) | LD (used) |     | LID (produced) | LD (produced) | LD (produced) | 
    
29. Sunlight -> Electrons -> ATP -> Glucose
30. Cellular Respiration
31. 31
	1. Over time, the carbon dioxide will get used up and turned into oxygen as photosynthesis happens, as the carbon will be taken from the molecule
	2. Oxygen will steadily increase over time as it is the direct product of taking the carbon from the carbon dioxide
	3. RuBP gets used and reused throughout the Calvin cycle, so its concentration will vary throughout the cycle
32. 32
	1. It fails to mention that some water is needed to start the reaction
	2. There are so many intermediary steps to get from light to glucose, such as the production of ATP and the entire Calvin cycle
