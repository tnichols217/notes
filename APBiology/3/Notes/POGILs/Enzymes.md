4. Pepsin is at its maximum reaction rate while Lipase is completely ineffective
5. Lipase is at its maximum reaction rate while Pepsin is completely ineffective
6. Their shape becomes malformed and their active site no longer binds to their matching molecules
7. 4 and 12, they have no function at all
8. 5, it has no function above this pH level
9. No, the pH levels are vastly different leading to different looking enzymes
10. It would look similar to that of Pepsin, high functionality at low pH levels
11. The digestion
