1. Pepsin and Lipase
2. 2
	1. Stomach
	2. Small Intestine
3. 3
	1. 1.5
	2. 8
4. Pepsin is at its maximum reaction rate while Lipase is completely ineffective
5. Lipase is at its maximum reaction rate while Pepsin is completely ineffective
6. Their shape becomes malformed and their active site no longer binds to their matching molecules
7. 4 and 12, they have no function at all
8. 5, it has no function above this pH level
9. No, the pH levels are vastly different leading to different looking enzymes
10. It would look similar to that of Pepsin, high functionality at low pH levels
11. The digestion ability would be greatly hindered as it would change the pH level to a level that isn't suitable for the enzymes in the stomach, greatly lowering its reaction rates
12. 12
	1. The most suitable temperature for Amylase is $40\degree C$, anything above would destroy the protein and anything below would reduce the speed of reaction by slowing the molecules
	2. Enzyme concentration is linearly related to reaction rate
	3. Higher Substrate concentration leads to a higher rate of reaction until you reach the saturation of enzymes, at which increasing the substrate concentration would only increase the chances of intersection with an enzyme
13. 13
	1. $40\degree C$
	2. It is its maximum operating temperature before it explodes
14. The proteins begin getting heat sterilized and completely nonfuctional
