1. Pepsin and Lipase
2. 2
	1. Stomach
	2. Small Intestine
3. 3
	1. 1.5
	2. 8
4. Pepsin is at its maximum reaction rate while Lipase is completely ineffective
5. Lipase is at its maximum reaction rate while Pepsin is completely ineffective
6. Their shape becomes malformed and their active site no longer binds to their matching molecules
7. 4 and 12, they have no function at all
8. 5, it has no function above this pH level
9. No, the pH levels are vastly different leading to different looking enzymes
10. It would look similar to that of Pepsin, high functionality at low pH levels
11. The digestion ability would be greatly hindered as it would change the pH level to a level that isn't suitable for the enzymes in the stomach, greatly lowering its reaction rates
12. 12
	1. The most suitable temperature for Amylase is $40\degree C$, anything above would destroy the protein and anything below would reduce the speed of reaction by slowing the molecules
	2. Enzyme concentration is linearly related to reaction rate
	3. Higher Substrate concentration leads to a higher rate of reaction until you reach the saturation of enzymes, at which increasing the substrate concentration would only increase the chances of intersection with an enzyme
13. 13
	1. $40\degree C$
	2. It is its maximum operating temperature before it explodes
14. The proteins begin getting heat sterilized and completely irreversibly dysfuctional
15. It could kill stomach enzymes, but also speed up the reaction rate of those that survive. After long periods of time, its likely that the stomach enzymes would be irreversibly denatured leading to a broken, slow, and ineffective digestion
16. 16
	1. Linearly related, more enzyme means more reaction
	2. If you have one car carrying 5kg, when you have two cars, now you can carry 10kg over the same time (linearly related)
17. Increasing and gently approaching a limit (the saturation of the enzymes) It will never reach the limit because you will never have a substrate perfectly take the place of the previous product immediately, however increasing the substrate concentration leads to less time between production in the enzymes
18. Say you have 10 cars (enzymes) and you need to drive one lap then switch drivers and repeat this indefinitely. If you have more cars, more laps will be driven. If all the drivers (randomly distributed at the end zone) rush for the car after a lap is completed, if there are more people around, the chance that someone will be standing close to the car increases, leading to less down time before another lap can be driven (reducing wasted parked time)
19. Yes, but since it is a limit, it will never be practically reached unless your concentration is infinite, because attaching to an enzyme perfectly immediately after the product has been ejected is practically impossible to consistently reproduce even with a large concentration
20. (shift it $30\degree C$ to the right)
21. 21
	1. The bacteria already lives in a hot environment, so raising its temperature to $95\degree C$ wouldn't likely kill everything in the bacteria and would only delaminate the DNA. If this was done on human polymerase, other damage would likely happen, killing basically all working enzymes
	2. A lot of the rest of the human enzymes and proteins would be destroyed, including primers and other DNA effective machines
22. Linear, more enzyme means more coenzyme
23. Divide everything by like 4
