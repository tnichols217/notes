1.  Anabolic versus catabolic pathways
    
    1.  Definitions, examples

		>did you just **Anabolic**
		> Building stuff up or storing energy (photosynthesis)
		> 
		> **Catabolic**
		> Breaking stuff down or using energy (respiration)
        
    2.  Relationship between G, H, S – endergonic, exergonic – spontaneous, not spontaneous (see chart in notes)

		> **G** - Gibb's free energy - the maximum availiable energy in a closed system
		> **H** - Enthalpy - Energy needed or radiated from a reaction
		> **S** - Entropy - Unuseful energy used or absorbed, often heat
		> **Endergonic** - Net absorbtion of energy
		> **Exergonic** - Net release of energy

2.  First and second laws of thermodynamics and relationship to biology

	> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, which is what the Gibbs' free energy formula states
	> Energy dissipates, which means goes from high to low concentration, so heat cant move from a cold object to a hot object

3.  ATP Cycle – understand the diagram

	> ATP and ADP get recycled into each other, carrying energy around

4.  Oxidation/reduction in terms of H

	> Losing a hydrogen is oxidation, which releases energy, and gaining one is storing energy (reduction)

5.  Respiration
    
    1.  3 (or 4?) parts – study the summary chart!!!
		
		> Consists of Glycolysis, formation of acetyl CoA, Krebs Cycle, then ETC

    2.  Proton-motive force

		> When a high concentration of protons in a certain area has a tendency to move to a low concentration because of diffsion

    3.  Difference between hydrogen and proton

		> hydrogen normally has a neutron with it as well, a hydrogen ion (positively charged) doesn't have an electron, which is just a proton

    4.  Main idea of fermentation

		> Be able to produce energy even when there is air, the oxygen debt must be paid back later however

    5.  Lactic acid fermentation versus alcoholic fermentation

		> Alcoholic fermentation's oxygen debt cannot be paid back, so when there are high concentrations of it undealt with, it is toxic 

    6.  Facultative anaerobes, obligate anaerobes

		> **Facultative anaerobes** can use either aerobic or anaerobic respiration when there is or is no oxygen
		> **Obligate anaerobes** need to live in an oxygen free environment or they will die

6.  Photosynthesis
    
    1.  2 parts
        
        1.  Location

        2.  Function
            
        3.  Products
            
    2.  3 parts of Calvin Cycle
        
    3.  Why is light needed? Why is water needed?
        
    4.  Where does the oxygen gas come from?
        
    5.  Pigments – wavelengths of light -- difference between absorption and reflection – relation to color and use
        
    6.  Main idea of chemosynthesis
        
7.  Respiration versus photosynthesis – similarities and differences
    
    1.  Location of ETC, ATP synthase
        
    2.  Chemiosmosis
        
    3.  Reactants and products
        
    4.  Functions
        
    5.  Electron carriers
        
8.  How do bacteria do these processes?
    
9.  Reading charts and graphs related to experiments with these processes
