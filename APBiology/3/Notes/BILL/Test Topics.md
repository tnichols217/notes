1.  Anabolic versus catabolic pathways
    
    1.  Definitions, examples

		>did you just **Anabolic**
		> Building stuff up or storing energy (photosynthesis)
		> 
		> **Catabolic**
		> Breaking stuff down or using energy (respiration)
        
    2.  Relationship between G, H, S – endergonic, exergonic – spontaneous, not spontaneous (see chart in notes)

		> **G** - Gibb's free energy - the maximum availiable energy in a closed system
		> **H** - Enthalpy - Energy needed or radiated from a reaction
		> **S** - Entropy - Unuseful energy used or absorbed, often heat
		> **Endergonic** - Net absorbtion of energy
		> **Exergonic** - Net release of energy

2.  First and second laws of thermodynamics and relationship to biology

	> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, which is what the Gibbs' free energy formula states
	> Energy dissipates, which means goes from high to low concentration, so heat cant move from a cold object to a hot object

3.  ATP Cycle – understand the diagram

	> ATP and ADP get recycled into each other, carrying energy around

4.  Oxidation/reduction in terms of H

	> Losing a hydrogen is oxidation, which releases energy, and gaining one is storing energy (reduction)

5.  Respiration
    
    1.  3 (or 4?) parts – study the summary chart!!!
		
		> Consists of Glycolysis, formation of acetyl CoA, Krebs Cycle, then ETC

    2.  Proton-motive force

		> When a high concentration of protons in a certain area has a tendency to move to a low concentration because of diffsion

    3.  Difference between hydrogen and proton

		> hydrogen normally has a neutron with it as well, a hydrogen ion (positively charged) doesn't have an electron, which is just a proton

    4.  Main idea of fermentation

		> Be able to produce energy even when there is air, the oxygen debt must be paid back later however

    5.  Lactic acid fermentation versus alcoholic fermentation

		> Alcoholic fermentation's oxygen debt cannot be paid back, so when there are high concentrations of it undealt with, it is toxic 

    6.  Facultative anaerobes, obligate anaerobes

		> **Facultative anaerobes** can use either aerobic or anaerobic respiration when there is or is no oxygen
		> **Obligate anaerobes** need to live in an oxygen free environment or they will die

6.  Photosynthesis
    
    1.  2 parts
        
        1.  Location

			> Chloroplasts and cytosol

        2.  Function

			> Produce energy to use from light

        3.  Products

			> Glucose, Oxygen

    2.  3 parts of Calvin Cycle

		> Carbon Fixation, Reduction, Regeneration

    3.  Why is light needed? Why is water needed?

		> **Light**: As the source of energy
		> **Water**: To provide protons

    4.  Where does the oxygen gas come from?

		> Breaking the Carbon Dioxide for its Carbon

    5.  Pigments – wavelengths of light -- difference between absorption and reflection – relation to color and use

		> Chlorophyll reflects green and absorbs red and violet light

    6.  Main idea of chemosynthesis

		> Using inorganic carbon to produce organic material. In this case, using carbon dioxide to produce glucose

7.  Respiration versus photosynthesis – similarities and differences
    
    1.  Location of ETC, ATP synthase

		> Across the Thylakoid membrane vs mitochondrial membrane
		> Same, uses proton gradient to spin the thingy

    2.  Chemiosmosis

		> Producing ATP from a proton gradient

    3.  Reactants and products

		> Basically opposites, except the input energy for photosynthesis is light, when the output energy for respiration is ATP (chemical energy)

    4.  Functions

		> Save energy, use stored energy

    5.  Electron carriers

		> Carry electrons and energy to places to produce things. often NADH, NADPH, FADH

8.  How do bacteria do these processes?

	> Small-ly
	> They don't they leech from other things
