1.  Anabolic versus catabolic pathways
    
    1.  Definitions, examples

		> **Anabolic**
		> Building stuff up or storing energy (photosynthesis)
		> 
		> **Catabolic**
		> Breaking stuff down or using energy (respiration)
        
    2.  Relationship between G, H, S – endergonic, exergonic – spontaneous, not spontaneous (see chart in notes)

> 		**G** - Gibb's free energy - the maximum availiable energy in a closed sys
        
2.  First and second laws of thermodynamics and relationship to biology
    
3.  ATP Cycle – understand the diagram
    
4.  Oxidation/reduction in terms of H
    
5.  Respiration
    
    1.  3 (or 4?) parts – study the summary chart!!!
        
    2.  Proton-motive force
        
    3.  Difference between hydrogen and proton
        
    4.  Main idea of fermentation
        
    5.  Lactic acid fermentation versus alcoholic fermentation
        
    6.  Facultative anaerobes, obligate anaerobes
        
6.  Photosynthesis
    
    1.  2 parts

    4.  Where does the oxygen gas come from?
        
    5.  Pigments – wavelengths of light -- difference between absorption and reflection – relation to color and use
        
    6.  Main idea of chemosynthesis
