1. $40\degree C$
2. 40: $4\degree C$, 50: $10\degree C$
3. It increases as the gap between gross and net increase. Its because the temperature is higher so the molecules move faster and react faster.
4. It begins low, then increases until $40\degree C$ and goes down after that
5. Photosynthesis seems to have an optimum temperature at $40\degree C$ while respiration seems to keep getting faster as the temperature increases.
