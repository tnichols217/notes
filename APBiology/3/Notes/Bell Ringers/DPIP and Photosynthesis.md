   1. Green: Light, unboiled
   2. Purple: Dark, unboiled
   3. White: Light, boiled
2. Light, unboiled for each time as it is the default without changing anything in its default environment
3. When it is dark, there is less light that the environment, the choloplasts are less active, meaning there is less electrons, which means there is less reduction going on.
   When it is boiled, some of the enzymes needed for photosynthesis are destroyed, which decreases the effectivity of the photosynthetic process
