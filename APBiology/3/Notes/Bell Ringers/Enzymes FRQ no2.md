   rr = 0.3821 $\micro \text{M}/\text{min}$ 
2. Because as the reaction goes on, the substrates get used up to create products, so at around 30 mins the substrates are running out so the probability that fewer substrates would bump into the same amount of enzymes is less, resulting in a lower reaction rate

   Since the enzyme is doubled, the reaction time should
