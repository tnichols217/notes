|   | The electron transport chain transfers energy from         |     |
|   | electrons in a series of coupled reactions that establish  |     |
|   | an electrochemical gradient across membranes-              |     |

|   |     > chloroplasts, mitochondria, and prokaryotic plasma   |     |

|   | **Explain how cells obtain energy from biological          |     |
|   | macromolecules in order to power cellular functions.       |     |
|   | *ENE-1.L***                                                |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | Glycolysis is a biochemical pathway that releases energy   |     |
|   | in glucose to form ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate,   |     |
|   | NADH from NAD+ and pyruvate.                               |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | Pyruvate is transported from the cytosol to the            |     |
|   | mitochondrion, where further oxidation occurs.             |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | In the Krebs cycle, carbon dioxide is released from        |     |
|   | organic intermediate, ATP is synthesized from ADP and      |     |
|   | inorganic phosphate, and electrons are transferred to the  |     |
|   | coenzymesNADH and FADH~2~.                                 |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | Electrons extracted in glycolysis and Krebs cycle          |     |
|   | reactions are transferred by NADH and FADH~2~ to the       |     |
|   | electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial        |     |
|   | membrane.                                                  |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | When electrons are transferred between molecules in a      |     |
|   | sequence of reactions as they pass through the ETC, an     |     |
|   | electrochemical gradient of protons (hydrogen ions) across |     |
|   | the inner mitochondrial membrane is established.           |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | Fermentation allows glycolysis to proceed in the absence   |     |
|   | of oxygen and produces organic molecules, including        |     |
|   | alcohol and lactic acid, as waste products.                |     |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+-----+
|   | The conversion of ATP to ADP releases energy, which is     |     |
|   | used to power many metabolic processes.                    |     |
|   |                                                            |     |
