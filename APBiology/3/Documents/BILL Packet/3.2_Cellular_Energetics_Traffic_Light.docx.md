**Traffic Lights**: Cellular Energetics

*AP Biology*

Traffic lights is an activity to identify and learn prefixes (ex:
cata-), root words, and suffixes (ex: -ate) that are content-specific
for current unit of study. Below is a list of the words followed by two
blank columns. The first column, labeled pre-assessment, is to be
highlighted/colored in to indicate the level of understanding you have
for the word. Green means you know it in the context of biology, yellow
means you are familiar with the word but have some uncertainty in the
context of biology, and red means that you don't know the word in any
context. For any term colored red or yellow you will need to define the
word, describe them in your own words, explain how each is used in the
current unit and then create a visual representation of each. These must
be done in your **BILL** using foldables, notecards, or any other method
that you come up with. These are **NOT** to be done electronically. At
the end of the unit you will reevaluate your knowledge of the terms
using traffic lights and take an assessment.
