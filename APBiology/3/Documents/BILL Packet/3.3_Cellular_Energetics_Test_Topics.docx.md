**AP Biology**

**Unit 3 -- Bioenergetics Test Topics**

1.  Anabolic versus catabolic pathways

    a.  Definitions, examples

    b.  Relationship between G, H, S -- endergonic, exergonic --
        spontaneous, not spontaneous (see chart in notes)

2.  First and second laws of thermodynamics and relationship to biology

3.  ATP Cycle -- understand the diagram

4.  Oxidation/reduction in terms of H

5.  Respiration

    a.  3 (or 4?) parts -- study the summary chart!!!

    b.  Proton-motive force

    c.  Difference between hydrogen and proton

    d.  Main idea of fermentation

    f.  Facultative anaerobes, obligate anaerobes

6.  Photosynthesis

    a.  2 parts

        i.  Location

        ii. Function

        iii. Products

    b.  3 parts of Calvin Cycle

    c.  Why is light needed? Why is water needed?

    d.  Where does the oxygen gas come from?

    e.  Pigments -- wavelengths of light \-- difference between
        absorption and reflection -- relation to color and use

    f.  Main idea of chemosynthesis

7.  Respiration versus photosynthesis -- similarities and differences
