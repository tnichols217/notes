	- Only if it is surrounded Hydrogen and often other elements
- If there is no carbon it is considered **inorganic**

## Carbon skeletons
### Length
- The length of the carbon chain may vary.
### Branching
- It may be branched or unbranched or branched in a different pattern
### Double bond position
- Double bonds may vary in position
### Prescence of rings
- Some carbon molecules form rings
- A simple hexagon represents a hexagon of Carbon (Cyclohexane)
- A simple hexagon with alternating double bonds represents Benzene
