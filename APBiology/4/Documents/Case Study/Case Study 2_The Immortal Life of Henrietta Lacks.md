# Case Study: The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

“Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor black tobacco farmer whose cells -- taken without her knowledge in 1951 -- became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and more. Henrietta’s cells have been bought and sold by the billions, yet she remains virtually unknown, and her family can’t afford health insurance.“ [http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/](http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/)

## Questions

**Completely answer** all the questions below on a separate sheet of paper. 

1.  Who was Henrietta Lacks? (You will need to listen to the entire podcast before you will learn all of the information needed to completely answer this question.)
2.  Why did Henrietta seek medical attention at Johns Hopkins Hospital?
3.  Why were Henrietta’s cells of interest to tissue culture researchers? Which cells did they take from her body?
4.  Specifically what did Henrietta die of? How old was she when she died? (You will need to listen to the entire podcast before you will learn all of the information needed to completely answer this question.)
5.  Researchers took cell samples from Henrietta on two occasions. Describe.
6.  What is HeLa? What’s so special about these cells?
7.  Why have HeLa cells been important to research on polio and other medical conditions?
8.  What problem did HeLa cells eventually cause for cell biology researchers?
9.  When did Henrietta’s family learn of the importance of her cells? Did her family have a good understanding of what HeLa cells were and why are they important? Do you think the medical establishment did right by Henrietta’s family?

## Your thoughts

10.  Should tissue be removed from a patient without his or her consent for research?
11.  Put the use of HeLa cells on trial.  What is more important: an individual’s rights to his/her own body tissues or the medical knowledge gained by studying a patient’s tissues?
12.  Should Henrietta Lack’s family be compensated for the discoveries made by using her cells?
13.  Do companies or universities have the right to patent discoveries made using a patient’s tissues or genes without consulting the patient?
14.  What other legal and ethical questions does this make you think about?
15.  What are your thoughts on this topic from a biblical worldview?  (You can think about this either from the family’s point of view or the researchers’).
