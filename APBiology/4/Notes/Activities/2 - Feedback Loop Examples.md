# Regulated Blood Glucose Concentration (Negative feedback)
## When Glucose level rises above set point
1. Pancreas is stimulated to secrete insulin from beta cells
2. Insulin levels increase in the bloodstream
3. Cells take up glucose from the blood
4. Liver uses excess glucose to produce glycogen
5. Blood glucose levels out

## When Glucose levels drop below set point
1. Pancreas is stimulated to secrete glucagon from alpha cells
2. Glucagon levels in the bloodstream increase
3. Glycogen is broken down by the liver
4. Glucose is released into the bloodstream
5. Blood glucose level rises

# Graphs
1. When there is more glucose, more insulin is secreted
2. When there is more glucose, less glucagon is secreted
3. 3
	1. B
	2. A - 90mg/dL
	3. C - below set point

# Thermoregulation (Negative feedback)
## When Body temperature increases above set point
1. Thermostat in hypothalamus activates cooling mechanism in the brain
2. Blood vessels in your skin dilate, releasing heat
3. Body temperature decreases back to set point

## When Body temperature decreases below set point
1. Thermostat in hypothalamus activates warming mechanism in the brain
2. Blood vessels in your skin contract, generating heat and moves heat to the body's core
3. Body temperature increases back to set point

# Temperature regulators and conformers
- Regulators maintain homeostatis in their temperature
- Conformers conform to the environment's temperature

# Osmoregulation in Marine Fishes vs. Freshwater
1. Saltwater fish will excrete salt because their food and drink contain salt, so to maintain homeostasis in through osmoregulation, salt is excreted in urine to maintain constant salt levels within the fish
2. Freshwater fishes' food does not contain as much salt, so it is not necessary to excrete as much salt to maintain homeostasis in the concentration within the fish. Also, excreting to much salt would make the osmolarity of the fish very low, leading it to have bloated cells.

# Fruit Ripening (Positive feedback)
1. Ethylene gas is produced in one fruit by ripening
2. Nearby fruit detect the release of the gas
3. Nearby fruit ripen and release the same gas
4. More nearby fruits detect the gas and release more gas
5. More fruit ripen

## Questions
1. What does it mean for a fruit to ripen? Describe what happens when a fruit becomes ripe.
	- Become more palatable for seed dispersion from other organisms
2. Why is it important for a fruit to ripen? What would happen if a fruitâ€™s ethylene receptors were mutated?
	- Produce flavor, color, and texture

## Signal transduction in fruit ripening
1. Phosphorylate the neighboring EIN2 so that it cannot enter the nucleus
2. It provides the phophate group to phosphorylate the EIN2
3. EBF1/2 F-box blocks EIN3/EIL1 from allowing Ethelene from being produced. EIN2 C-end comes and blocks EBF 1/2 F-box, which allows EIN3/EIL1 to produce ethelene gas

# Childbirth (Positive feedback)
1. The baby's head pushes on the cervix, applying pressure on it
2. Nerve impulses from the cervix are transmitted to the brain
3. Brain stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete oxytocin
4. Oxytocin is released into the bloodstream and is carried to the uterus
5. Oxytocin stimulated the uterus to contract, moving baby towards cervix

## Questions
![[Pasted image 20221211175225.png]]
1. Identify the independent and dependent variables.
	- Gestational age is independent and OXT concentration is dependent
2. Describe the relationship between gestational age and oxytocin concentration.
	- As the fetus grows older, OXT concentration increases to stimulate contraction for childbirth
