# Essential Questions:

▼ How do shared conserved cellular processes support the idea that all organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry?

▼ How do cells create and maintain internal environments that are different from their external environments?

▼ How do structure and function of subcellular components and their interactions provide essential cellular processes?

▼ How do cells maintain dynamic homeostasis by the movement of molecules across membranes?
