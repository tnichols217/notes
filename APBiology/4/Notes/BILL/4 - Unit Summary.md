# Objectives:

1.  Be able to discuss the evolution of cells including the endosymbiont theory.
	- Slow evolution and modification of dna leads to different cells and cells that adapt better to their environment and those that leard how to defend themselves as well. Endosymbiosis is when cells incorporate other cells as part of themselves to create a megacell.
2.  Be able to differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells according to the types of organelles are contained in each and in which organisms.
	- check for nuclear envelope
3.  Be able to identify the differences between plant and animal cells (organelles).
	- Check for chloroplasts and cell wall
4.  Be able to diagram the structure of the cell membrane and discuss its function.
	- Phospholipid bilayer with a bunch of proteins in it
5.  Be able to discuss the principles of osmosis and diffusion in plant and animal cells.
	- Flows from high to low concentration (of water)
6.  Be able to explain the difference between active and passive transport.
	- Passive is with gradient, active is against and uses a protein and energy
7.  Be able to discuss and give examples of endocytosis and exocytosis in cells.
	- When the bilayer folds around molecules to take them into the cell

# Essential Questions:

- How do shared conserved cellular processes support the idea that all organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry?
	- It would be practically impossible for two completely independent evolutionary processes to create the same system without sharing something
- How do cells create and maintain internal environments that are different from their external environments?
	- With the cell membrane selectively allowing what can come in the cell. Also sometimes it can expel extra substances.
- How do structure and function of subcellular components and their interactions provide essential cellular processes?
	- No one thing can do everything, so this allows the cell to do complicated things, like how mitochondria cant directly break down glucose, but only pyrivic acid
- How do cells maintain dynamic homeostasis by the movement of molecules across membranes?
	- Allowing or blocking protein channels
