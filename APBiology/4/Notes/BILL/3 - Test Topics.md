# Test Topics

-   Prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells
	- Prokaryotes are thought to be the evolutionary ancestors of the eukaryotes due to their comparative simplicity and lack of certain organelles and a nuclear envelope.
-   Why are cells small?
	- To maximize SA:V ratio in order to maximize transfer of molecules in and out of the cell
-   Organelles – function and structure
	- They all have different purposes for the cell ranging from breaking down energy to providing protection and structure for the cell
-   Where is DNA found?
	- In the nucleolus
-   Plant vs. animal cells
	- Plants have additional chloroplasts and a cell wall
-   Endosymbiosis theory
	- When cells get incorporated into other cells
-   Endomembrane system
	- Consists of the nucleus, rough ER, ribosomes, lysosomes, smooth ER, and the golgi
-   Structure of the cell membrane – components and functions and Fluid mosaic model
	- Has a phospholipid bilayer and has many different channels, receptors, and other things that go through the wall
-   Membrane responses to cold
	- Cell signalling happens in order to maintain homeostasis
-   What does amphipathic mean?
	- Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
-   How do different types of molecules get through the cell membrane?
	- Either through diffusion or with a transport protein or not at all
-   Passive transport vs. active transport and types of each
	- passive goes down the gradient without a protein
-   Types of bulk transport
-   Specific types of transport – sodium/potassium pump and cotransporters
-   Isotonic/hypotonic/hypertonic and effect on cells – difference in plants and animals
-   How does water get through the cell membrane
-   Water potential – factors that change movement of water
-   Lab concepts – diffusion/osmosis
