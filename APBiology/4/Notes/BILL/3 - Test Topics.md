# Test Topics

-   Prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic cells
	- Prokaryotes are thought to be the evolutionary ancestors of the eukaryotes due to their comparative simplicity and lack of certain organelles and a nuclear envelope.
-   Why are cells small?
	- To maximize SA:V ratio in order to maximize transfer of molecules in and
