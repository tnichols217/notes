1. Compare and contrast the reasons cell division is important for unicellular (single-celled) and multicellular organisms.
	- For single-celled organisms, its the only way they can reproduce.
	- For multi-cellular organisms, cell division is used to replaced broken or damaged pieces, and grow
2. Provide an example of why cell division remains important to an adult organism even after it is fully developed.
	- To renew old and dead cells, as well as damaged cells from cuts or broken things.
3. What is the role of growth factors?
	- A bunch of chemicals that when are concentrated enough, signal cell division
4. Cells divide, differentiate, or die. What is differentiation?
	- When cells undergo a change in gene expression in order to specialize for a particular function like bones or muscles.
5. What is apoptosis? Explain its purpose.
	- Planned cell death, when something goes wrong it will self destruct
6. Organisms maintain the right number of cells by regulating the cell cycle. What are “cell cycle regulators?”
	- Signals that start, enhance, or stop cell division and growth, signal to start differentiation or apoptosis
7. Watch the video clip of cells in the small intestine. Name the general location along the villus where the following processes occur:
	1. Cell Division
		- Crypt
	2. Cell Differentiation
		- Lumen
	3. Apoptosis
		- TOp of vilius
8. Name one harmless result of too little cell division
	- Hair loss
9. Name one harmless result of too much cell division.
	- Growth of warts
10. List, in order, the four events we collectively call the “cell cycle.” Next to each event, write the correlating cell cycle phase name.
	- G1, S, G2, M
11. In general, what is the purpose of a checkpoint in the cell cycle?
	- To make sure the cell is ready to progress to the next phase and to make sure there is nothing wrong
12. What is one potential outcome when errors occur in this highly regulated cell cycle process?
	- Cancer
13. What type of protein that regulates the cell cycle is encoded by proto-oncogenes?
	- Stimulating proteins
14. What type of protein that regulates the cell cycle is encoded by tumor suppressor genes?
	- Inhibitory proteins
15. The most important cell cycle regulators are the
	- CDKs
16. What is a kinase, and what does it do?
	- Enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins in order to inhibit or activate them
17. When are CDKs present inside the cell during the cell cycle?
	- Always
18. When are cyclins present inside the cell during the cell cycle?
	- Always increasing but drops back to almost none during mitosis
19. CDKs form molecular complexes with cyclins. What do activated CDK-cyclin complexes do?
	- Stimulate the cell cycle and promote growth
20. Go to “Cell Cycle Phases” and click on “Interphase.” The interphase alternates with mitosis. What happens during interphase and what phases does it include?
	- G1, S, G2, the time when growth and DNA replication happens
21. Go to “Cell Cycle Phases” and click on “G0.” The G0 phase is a resting or nondividing stage. What three factors determine if a cell enters G0?
	- Stage in development, type of cell, and resources
22. Provide an example of a fully differentiated cell that is (a) permanently in G0 and (b) one that can leave G0 to progress through the cell cycle and divide again.
	- Neurons
	- Spinal cord
23. Cancer is an improperly regulated cell cycle. Name two reasons why cells can form tumors.
	- Uncontrolled division, uncontrolled death
24. What causes uncontrolled cell division at the genetic level?
	- Mutations breaking the checkpoints
25. Watch the video clip. At the cellular level in this example, explain what occurs if the APC gene is mutated.
	- Makes it unstable and more likely to cause cancer
26. Normally, proto-oncogenes stimulate the cell cycle. What do mutated proto-oncogenes (i.e., oncogenes) cause?
	- More stimulation of the cell cycle
27. Normally, tumor suppressor genes inhibit the cell cycle. What do mutated tumor suppressor genes cause?
	- Uncontrollable cell growth
28. To cause cancer, proto-oncogenes require 1 allele to be mutated and are therefore considered dominant. This results in a gain of function.
29. To cause cancer, tumor suppressor genes require 2 alleles to be mutated and are therefore considered recessive. This results in a decrease of function.
30. Watch the video clip.
	1. Using the gas pedal analogy, explain the impact on the cell cycle of a proto-oncogene versus an oncogene.
		- When broken, the gas pedal gets pressed more, accelerating the cell cycle
	2. Using the brake pedal analogy, explain the impact on the cell cycle of one mutated tumor suppressor gene allele versus two mutated tumor suppressor alleles.
		- When there is a mutation, it breaks the foot and you can no longer press the gas pedal.
31. p53 is a protein that is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, and some scientists refer to it as “the guardian of the genome.”
	1. Explain its normal role and why scientists would regard it as the “guardian of the genome.”
		- It prevents entering the S stage when there are problems with DNA, so it stops bad DNA from replicating
	2. Explain what happens to the cell cycle if both alleles of the gene encoding p53 are mutated.
		- The checkpoint will be broken and broken DNA will not stop the cell cycle.
32. Explain why people who inherit one mutated allele of the BRCA1 gene have a higher likelihood of developing cancer.
	- It normally fixes the errors in DNA, so a broken BRCA1 gene would prevent this from happening if the DNA is broken
33. Predict a potential outcome of a mutated mitotic arrest deficient (MAD) protein.
	- Cells with the incorrect number of chromosomes because they never attached properly and was not detected.
34. Use the model illustrated in the figure below to answer the accompanying questions.
	1. The human gene EGFR located on chromosome 7 is a proto-oncogene that codes for a growth factor cell surface receptor. The binding of growth factors to this receptor can lead to cell proliferation. Hypothesize what potential impact a mutated EGFR allele will have on a cell. Give one possible impact and explain your answer.
		- A modified EGFR would most likely be unable to bind to growth factors, meaning that it would not signal cell proliferation and the cell would probably die
	2. RAS is a G protein that is activated when a growth factor attaches to EGFR. Its activation results in the exchange of GTP for GDP. Once activated, the GTP cannot be hydrolyzed and RAS cannot be deactivated What is one potential outcome of a mutation in one of the two copies of RAS?
		- A mutation in RAS would most likely disable it from performing its function of signalling BRAF and would most likely fail to be phosphrylated by EGFR as well, permanently staying inactive.
	3. Mutations in the genes that code for proteins in this pathway have been linked to various types of cancer (i.e., RAS: pancreatic, BRAF: colorectal, MEK: melanoma, EGFR: lung). If you were developing a new cancer drug, what would be an appropriate target protein for the new drug therapy? Justify your answer.
		- MEK, because it is the last protein in the chain and would ignore all the problems with the rest of the chain
