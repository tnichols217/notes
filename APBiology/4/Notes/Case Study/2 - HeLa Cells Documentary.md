1.  Who was Henrietta Lacks? (You will need to listen to the entire podcast before you will learn all of the information needed to completely answer this question.)
	- A black tobacco farmer with a special mutation in her cells that wouldn't die even after regrowing forever
2.  Why did Henrietta seek medical attention at Johns Hopkins Hospital?
	- She felt a lump inside of her
3.  Why were Henrietta’s cells of interest to tissue culture researchers? Which cells did they take from her body?
	- Her cells wouldn't die even after growing extensively
4.  Specifically what did Henrietta die of? How old was she when she died? (You will need to listen to the entire podcast before you will learn all of the information needed to completely answer this question.)
	- Cervical cancer at 31
5.  Researchers took cell samples from Henrietta on two occasions. Describe.
	- They took some when she was receiving treatment and some after she died
6.  What is HeLa? What’s so special about these cells?
	- They are the first undying human cells ever discovered. They can grow and divide unlimitedly.
7.  Why have HeLa cells been important to research on polio and other medical conditions?
	- We can study viruses easier with an unlimited supply of human cells
8.  What problem did HeLa cells eventually cause for cell biology researchers?
	- HeLa can take over other cells and grow very aggressively, they contaminated many other cells.
9.  When did Henrietta’s family learn of the importance of her cells? Did her family have a good understanding of what HeLa cells were and why are they important? Do you think the medical establishment did right by Henrietta’s family?
	- They only found out a long time after she died. I don't think the family had a good understanding of what was going on because they weren't particularly science oriented. I feel like this is not fair because the family has the right to know what happened to her and why they were taking samples from her and the family as well. They didn't even let them know they were taking samples from her.

## Your thoughts

1.  Should tissue be removed from a patient without his or her consent for research?
	- No. Their tissue is part of them and without consent, you are just stealing something that is theirs.
2.  Put the use of HeLa cells on trial.  What is more important: an individual’s rights to his/her own body tissues or the medical knowledge gained by studying a patient’s tissues?
	- The individual should have the rights to choose what should be done to his or her body. Even though it helped the medical community as a whole, it should have been explained to her and she should have had the chance to agree to it regardless
3.  Should Henrietta Lack’s family be compensated for the discoveries made by using her cells?
	- Yes, or atleast Henrietta atleast. While it was claimed that they sold them at cost, there were many examples where money was made off of her cells. Imagine her cells as intellectual and physical property, of the family and Henrietta herself, it wouldn't be right to use it without permission.
4.  Do companies or universities have the right to patent discoveries made using a patient’s tissues or genes without consulting the patient?
	- No. The patient should be made aware and have the chance to choose what happens with the discovery as it happened because of her.
5.  What other legal and ethical questions does this make you think about?
	- None really
6.  What are your thoughts on this topic from a biblical worldview?  (You can think about this either from the family’s point of view or the researchers’).
	- I believe that the family should have known and that it is ethically wrong to operate on patients with false pretenses and without consent.
