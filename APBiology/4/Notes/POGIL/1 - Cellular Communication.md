1. Consider the diagrams in Model 1 of four types of cellular communication. Match each of the shapes below with a label at the right.
	1. ![[Pasted image 20221211151226.png]] Signalling molecule (ligand)
	2. ![[Pasted image 20221211151325.png]] Cell
	3. ![[Pasted image 20221211151335.png]] Membrane Channel
	4. ![[Pasted image 20221211151347.png]] Receptor
2. Describe how the shape of the ligand (signaling molecule) and the shape of the receptor are related.
3. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells that are in close proximity?
4. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells in different parts of an organism (long-distance communication)?
5. In which of the cellular communication methods would a ligand (signaling molecule) need to have the longest “life”? Explain your reasoning
6. Use the four terms below to label the diagrams in Model 1. Word-part definitions are given to help you determine the meanings of each term.
7. Cellular communication takes place for a variety of reasons—mating, defense mechanisms, homeostasis, growth, etc. Discuss the following question with your group and make a prediction: “Do all ligands for cellular communication have the same chemical structure (shape)?” Provide specifi c reasons or examples to support your prediction.
8. Consider each of the following cellular communication examples. Divide the work among group members. Have each group member determine which type of signaling is being used in their scenario (autocrine, juxtacrine, paracrine or endocrine), and then present their reasoning to the group
	1. Quorum sensing is used by bacteria to determine the population density of their species in a local area. (Many bacterial functions would be ineffective in small numbers—infecting a host organism with a toxin, for example—and would therefore be a waste of energy and resources to the bacteria.) Each bacterium produces a ligand. Once the concentration of that ligand reaches a critical concentration, thus indicating a suffi cient population density for the response to be effective, all bacteria will respond simultaneously
	2. Plants construct channels between cells called plasmodesmata that allow ligands to move directly from one cell to another throughout the plant structure.
	3. Morphogens are produced in embryos from a central source early in development. They diffuse throughout the tissue creating a concentration gradient that provides a spatial reference for developing cells. Cells far from the morphogen production will develop into one type of tissue while cells close to the source will develop into a different type of tissue. This allows for differentiation of cell structure early in embryotic development.
	4. Cells in the human pancreas release insulin when blood sugar levels are elevated. The insulin signals cells in the liver to begin absorbing glucose and convert it to glycogen for storage.
