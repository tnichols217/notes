1. Consider the diagrams in Model 1 of four types of cellular communication. Match each of the shapes below with a label at the right.
	1. ![[Pasted image 20221211151226.png]] Signalling molecule (ligand)
	2. ![[Pasted image 20221211151325.png]] Cell
	3. ![[Pasted image 20221211151335.png]] Membrane Channel
	4. ![[Pasted image 20221211151347.png]] Receptor
2. Describe how the shape of the ligand (signaling molecule) and the shape of the receptor are related.
3. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells that are in close proximity?
4. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells in different parts of an organism (long-distance communication)?
