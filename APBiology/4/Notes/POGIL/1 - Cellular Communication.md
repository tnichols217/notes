1. Consider the diagrams in Model 1 of four types of cellular communication. Match each of the shapes below with a label at the right.
	1. ![[Pasted image 20221211151226.png]] Signalling molecule (ligand)
	2. ![[Pasted image 20221211151325.png]] Cell
	3. ![[Pasted image 20221211151335.png]] Membrane Channel
	4. ![[Pasted image 20221211151347.png]] Receptor
2. Describe how the shape of the ligand (signaling molecule) and the shape of the receptor are related.
	- The ligand fits perfectly into the active site of the receptor, binding together. They have inversely matching shapes
3. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells that are in close proximity?
	- B or C, C is close proximity while B is touching
4. Which of the cellular communication methods in Model 1 appear to be for signaling between cells in different parts of an organism (long-distance communication)?
	- D, it goes down the bloodstream
5. In which of the cellular communication methods would a ligand (signaling molecule) need to have the longest “life”? Explain your reasoning
	- D, it needs to travel all the way down the bloodstream
6. Use the four terms below to label the diagrams in Model 1. Word-part definitions are given to help you determine the meanings of each term.
	1. Autocrine (auto = self)
		- ![[Pasted image 20221211153114.png]]
	2. Paracrine (para = nearby)
		- ![[Pasted image 20221211153129.png]]
	3. Juxtacrine (juxta = beside, next to, touching)
		- ![[Pasted image 20221211153142.png]]
	4. Endocrine (endo = within)
		- ![[Pasted image 20221211153205.png]]
7. Cellular communication takes place for a variety of reasons — mating, defense mechanisms, homeostasis, growth, etc. Discuss the following question with your group and make a prediction: “Do all ligands for cellular communication have the same chemical structure (shape)?” Provide specific reasons or examples to support your prediction.
	- No, if they did then all receptors would receive all signals, which would lead to the same signal signalling everything
8. Consider each of the following cellular communication examples. Divide the work among group members. Have each group member determine which type of signaling is being used in their scenario (autocrine, juxtacrine, paracrine or endocrine), and then present their reasoning to the group
	1. **Quorum sensing** is used by bacteria to determine the population density of their species in a local area. (Many bacterial functions would be ineffective in small numbers—infecting a host organism with a toxin, for example—and would therefore be a waste of energy and resources to the bacteria.) Each bacterium produces a ligand. Once the concentration of that ligand reaches a critical concentration, thus indicating a sufficient population density for the response to be effective, all bacteria will respond simultaneously
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221211152026.png]]
		- Autocrine and paracrine, as it receives its own signals as well as the ones nearby
	2. Plants construct channels between cells called **plasmodesmata** that allow ligands to move directly from one cell to another throughout the plant structure.
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221211152033.png]]
		- Paracrine, its going directly to a cell touching the other one
	3. **Morphogens** are produced in embryos from a central source early in development. They diffuse throughout the tissue creating a concentration gradient that provides a spatial reference for developing cells. Cells far from the morphogen production will develop into one type of tissue while cells close to the source will develop into a different type of tissue. This allows for differentiation of cell structure early in embryotic development.
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221211152041.png]]
		- Paracrine, it only signals nearby cells
	4. Cells in the human pancreas release insulin when blood sugar levels are elevated. The insulin signals cells in the liver to begin absorbing glucose and convert it to glycogen for storage.
		- Endocrine, it sends it across the body through the bloodstreams
9. Consider each of the following cellular communication examples. Divide the work among group members. Have each group member determine which type of signaling is being used in their scenario (autocrine, juxtacrine, paracrine or endocrine), and then present their reasoning to the group.
	1. **Pheromones** released by a female gamete cell (egg) provide a pathway for the male gamete cell (sperm) to travel, increasing the possibility of fertilization.
		- Endocrine, it signals it far away through the bloodstream
	2. Some cancer cells release their own growth hormone rather than relying on growth hormones from the host organism or from other cells. This presents challenges to cancer researchers looking for ways to slow the growth of cancer cells.
		- Autocrine, it stimulates itself
	3. **Neurotransmitters** are ligands that are released from the axon of one nerve cell to the dendrite of another nerve cell. This helps to propagate the signal across several cells.
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221211152055.png]]
		- Paracrine, because they are nearby
	4. Cells in the pituitary gland produce thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is received by cells in the thyroid. The arrival of TSH in the thyroid triggers production of several hormones, which then travel throughout the body to regulate metabolism.
		- Endocrine, it travels through the bloodstream
10. If a medical researcher wanted to prevent communication between cells in order to cure a disease or prevent a malady, how might they achieve that? Propose two or more general methods that could be used to stop a signal transmission from cell to cell.
	- Prevent the signal from being emitted, or destroy the receptors so that it wouldn't be received. Alternatively, you could break the signal transduction chain.
11. If a medical researcher wanted to enhance communication between cells in order to cure a disease or prevent a malady, how might they achieve that? Propose two or more general methods that could be used to enhance signal transmission from cell to cell.
	- Add more receptors to the cells or stimulate cells to emit more signalling molecules
12. The examples of cellular communication used in this activity vary from bacteria to plants to vertebrates. However, the mechanisms of cellular communication are similar among varied species. Explain how scientists might use cellular communication systems to show evolutionary relatedness between species.
	- Show that the signals and receptors used are similar, this shows that they are highly likely to come from the same evolutionary process.
13. Some hormones such as estrogen and testosterone are lipids and are therefore nonpolar. Explain why a receptor protein would not be needed for this type of ligand to activate a response in a cell.
	- They can already diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer into the cell without the help of a receptor or channel.
14. Suggest some stimuli that might cause a cell to release a ligand and begin communication between cells.
	- Heat or cold, high blood sugar
