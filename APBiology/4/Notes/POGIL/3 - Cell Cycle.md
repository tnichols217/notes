1. Describe what would occur in the cell if the activated protein kinase enzymes continued to be active for a long period of time.
2. Starting at the starred cell, what is the order of the stages of a cell’s life?
3. During which phase does the size of the cell increase?
4. During which phase does the number of cells increase?
5. Considering your answer to Questions 3 and 4, identify two ways that the growth of an organism can be accomplished through the events of the cell cycle.
6. Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, often results in a tumor, or mass of abnormal cells. Some cancerous tumors consist of many cells that are much smaller than normal. According to Model 1, what part(s) of the cell cycle is (are) most likely being affected?
7. In Model 1, if the length of the arrow represents time, then for those cancerous cells, what happens to the time that is necessary for the cell cycle? What implication might this have for doctors who are treating cancer patients?
8. Model 2 presents cell cycle data for a typical human cell in culture. Use the phase names in Model 2 to label the G, M, and S phases in Model 1.
9. Looking at the third column of Model 2, compare the time spent in mitosis with the time spent in G1 in human cells and describe any difference.
10. Imagine 100 cells were chosen randomly from a tissue sample and examined under a microscope. In which phase of the cell cycle would you expect to find the largest number of cells? Explain.
11. Look again at Model 2. Compare the amount of DNA at the beginning and end of synthesis. Why did the amount of DNA change?
12. Fill in the “Key Process” column for synthesis phase in Model 2.
13. *Cyto = cell*, *kinesis = cutting*. What do you think takes place during cytokinesis?
14. Other than cytokinesis, what else occurs during the mitosis phase? Hint: Consider the sets of DNA in each cell.
15. Look carefully at information given to you in Model 1 and Model 2. Fill in the key process column in the table for G1.
16. If a culture in the lab starts with one human cell, how many cells will there be after 24 hours?
17. The total time for the phases listed in Model 2 is 24 hours. How many human cells will be in the culture after another 24 hours? Explain.
18. Is the original cell “dead” or does it disappear after mitosis? Explain your answer.
19. If a starfish sustains damage to a limb, it often grows a new one. If a human adult sustains damage to his or her spinal cord, mobility is often impaired. If a gecko loses its tail, it may grow a new one. Which type of cell is less likely to go through the cell cycle after being damaged— starfish limb, human spinal cord, or gecko tail? Support your answer.
