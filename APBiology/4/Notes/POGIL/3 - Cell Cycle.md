1. Describe what would occur in the cell if the activated protein kinase enzymes continued to be active for a long period of time.
	- It would just produce too many signals and uncontrollable cell growth
2. Starting at the starred cell, what is the order of the stages of a cell’s life?
	- Growth
	- Synthesis
	- Growth
	- PMAT (mitosis)
3. During which phase does the size of the cell increase?
	- G1 and G2
4. During which phase does the number of cells increase?
	- Cytokinesis (after mitosis)
5. Considering your answer to Questions 3 and 4, identify two ways that the growth of an organism can be accomplished through the events of the cell cycle.
	- More cells = more growth
6. Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, often results in a tumor, or mass of abnormal cells. Some cancerous tumors consist of many cells that are much smaller than normal. According to Model 1, what part(s) of the cell cycle is (are) most likely being affected?
	- The checkpoints, G1, and G2
7. In Model 1, if the length of the arrow represents time, then for those cancerous cells, what happens to the time that is necessary for the cell cycle? What implication might this have for doctors who are treating cancer patients?
	- G1 and G2 are shortened
8. Model 2 presents cell cycle data for a typical human cell in culture. Use the phase names in Model 2 to label the G, M, and S phases in Model 1.
	- Gap, Mitosis, Synthesis
9. Looking at the third column of Model 2, compare the time spent in mitosis with the time spent in G1 in human cells and describe any difference.
	- G1 takes 11x longer than Mitosis
10. Imagine 100 cells were chosen randomly from a tissue sample and examined under a microscope. In which phase of the cell cycle would you expect to find the largest number of cells? Explain.
	- Gap 1 because it takes the longest
11. Look again at Model 2. Compare the amount of DNA at the beginning and end of synthesis. Why did the amount of DNA change?
	- Half of it went to one cell and the other half to the other
12. Fill in the “Key Process” column for synthesis phase in Model 2.
	- DNA is duplicated from one chromatid to two per chromosome
13. *Cyto = cell*, *kinesis = cutting*. What do you think takes place during cytokinesis?
	- The cell gets split from one into two
14. Other than cytokinesis, what else occurs during the mitosis phase? Hint: Consider the sets of DNA in each cell.
	- DNA gets separated into the two cells
15. Look carefully at information given to you in Model 1 and Model 2. Fill in the key process column in the table for G1.
	- 
16. If a culture in the lab starts with one human cell, how many cells will there be after 24 hours?
17. The total time for the phases listed in Model 2 is 24 hours. How many human cells will be in the culture after another 24 hours? Explain.
18. Is the original cell “dead” or does it disappear after mitosis? Explain your answer.
19. If a starfish sustains damage to a limb, it often grows a new one. If a human adult sustains damage to his or her spinal cord, mobility is often impaired. If a gecko loses its tail, it may grow a new one. Which type of cell is less likely to go through the cell cycle after being damaged— starfish limb, human spinal cord, or gecko tail? Support your answer.
20. Occasionally cells stop dividing and enter another phase, G0 . If you damage your liver, new liver cells can be produced to replace up to 75% of the liver. However, if you sustain brain damage, your body does not produce new brain cells. Explain this observation using what you have learned about the cell cycle.
21. Keeping in mind the events of each part of the cell cycle, mark with a double arrow on Model 1 where those cells might (either temporarily or permanently) exit the cell cycle to G0 . Label this as G0 . Why did you choose this location for G0 ? Hint: Think of a place in the cell cycle where the cell is functioning normally, but not preparing to divide.
22. Consider a cell in G0. Use the information in both Models 1 and 2 to answer the following questions.
	1. In order for this cell to divide normally, what would need to occur?
	2. What if the phase(s) you identified in part a of this question did not occur? What would be the outcome for the cell in that case?
23. According to Model 3, ultraviolet light is affecting a cell in which phase of the cell cycle?
24. Ultraviolet light may cause DNA damage, which is known as a mutation. How might such damage affect events taking place during the synthesis phase? Hint: Use information from Model 2.
25. How might the DNA damage go on to affect the rest of the cell cycle if apoptosis did not occur?
26. Why might it be benefi cial to an organism for damaged cells to enter G0 instead of dividing once they exist?
27. What could happen, after several cell cycles, to an organism whose damaged cells did not go through apoptosis? In other words, what if a damaged cell that is supposed to die does not?
28. For each phase, describe at least one way mistakes during the cell cycle could result in problems.
29. Some types of cancers are treated with radiation, similar to ultraviolet light. Why might it be beneficial to irradiate cancer cells?
30. Plasmodial slime mold is an example of a multinucleated cell. It can be referred to as “one huge cytoplasmic mass with many nuclei” as seen to the right. What part of Model 1 is skipped in the formation of such a cell? Explain your answer.
31. Chemotherapy utilizes chemicals that disrupt various parts of the cell cycle, targeting rapidly growing cells. Paclitaxel (Taxol®) is one such drug that prevents the mitosis phase from taking place.
	1. Explain how this drug is useful as a cancer treatment.
	2. How might targeting rapidly growing cells explain common chemotherapy side effects such as hair loss and nausea?
