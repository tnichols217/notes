1. Describe what would occur in the cell if the activated protein kinase enzymes continued to be active for a long period of time.
2. Starting at the starred cell, what is the order of the stages of a cellâ€™s life?
3. During which phase does the size of the cell increase?
4. During which phase does the number of cells increase?
5. Considering your answer to Questions 3 and 4, identify two ways that the growth of an organism can be accomplished through the events of the cell cycle.
6. Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, often results in a tumor, or mass of abnormal cells. Some cancerous tumors consist of many cells that are much smaller than normal. According to Model 1, what part(s) of the cell cycle is (are) most likely being affected?
7. In Model 1, if the length of the arrow represents time, then for those cancerous cells, what happens to the time that is necessary for the cell cycle? What implication might this have for doctors who are treating cancer patients?
8. Model 2 presents cell cycle data for a typical human cell in culture. Use the phase names in Model 2 to label the G, M, and S phases in Model 1.
9. Looking at the third column of Model 2, compare the time spent in mitosis with the time spent in G1 in human cells and describe any difference.
10. Imagine 100 cells were chosen randomly from a tissue sample and examined under a microscope. In which phase of the cell cycle would you expect to find the largest number of cells? Explain.
11. Look again at Model 2. Compare the amount of DNA at the beginning and end of synthesis. Why did the amount of DNA change?
