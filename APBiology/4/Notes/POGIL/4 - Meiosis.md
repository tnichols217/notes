1. According to Model 1, in what type of organs are the cells that enter meiosis I found?
	- Sex organs
2. Considering what you already know about mitosis in cells, what event must take place during interphase before a cell proceeds to division?
	- DNA replication and cell growth
3. What two structures make up a single replicated chromosome?
	- Chromotids
4. In Model 1, how many replicated chromosomes does the cell contain during prophase?
	- 46
5. At which stage in meiosis I do the pairs of homologous chromosomes come together?
	- Metaphase 1
6. Once the chromosomes have formed a pair, what are they called?
	- homologous chromosomes make tetrad
7. At the end of meiosis I, two cells have been produced. How many replicated chromosomes are in each of these cells?
	- 23 chromosomes
8. Cells with a full set of chromosomes are referred to as diploid or 2n, whereas cells with half the chromosomes are haploid or n. At which stage(s) of meiosis I are the cells diploid and at which stage(s) are they haploid?
	- Diploid until cytokinesis 1 when they become haploid
9. Which of the statements below correctly describes the relationship between the cells at the end of telophase I and the original cell?
	- They have half the chromosomes
10. Considering the genetic makeup of the homologous pairs, will the cells at the end of telophase I be genetically identical to each other?
	- No, since crossing over happens they will be different
11. According to Model 2, where did each of the cells come from that started meiosis II?
	- Meiosis I
12. In meiosis I, during anaphase I, which structures separated—homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids?
	- The spindle fibers separate homologous chromosomes
13. In meiosis II, during anaphase II, which structures separated—homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids?
	- The spindle fibers separate the matching chromatids
14. At the end of the meiosis II are four daughter cells. Are they haploid or diploid? Explain your answer in a complete sentence.
	- Haploid they only have 23 chromosomes
15. Which of the statements below correctly describes the relationship between the cells at the end of meiosis II and the original cell?
	- The new cells have one copy of half of the genetic information in the original cell.
16. According to Model 3, what is the name given to the cells produced at the end of meiosis I in males?
	- Spermatids
17. What is the name given to the cells produced at the end of meiosis I in females?
	- Oocyte
18. Refer to Model 3.
	1. At the end of meiosis II in males, what cells are produced?
		- Sperm
	2. What do these cells (from the previous question) eventually become?
		- Part of the Zygote
19. Before fertilization, what happens to the secondary oocyte?
	- Meiosis 1
20. During fertilization which two cells come together? Be specific in your answer.
	- Mature sperm and secondary oocyte
21. During meiosis II, the secondary oocyte divides unevenly, with one cell (the ovum) receiving half of the chromosomes and nearly all the cytoplasm and organelles, while the other cell, the polar body, is much smaller and eventually degenerates. With your group, propose an explanation to explain why the secondary oocyte divides in this way.
	- It needs all the organelles from the mother cell, but not all of the genetic information
22. What is the ploidy of the zygote produced by fertilization—haploid or diploid?
	- Diploid, it has a pair of all 23 chromosomes
23. What would the ploidy of the zygote be if egg and sperm were produced by mitosis rather than meiosis? How would this affect the ploidy of each successive generation?
	- Quadroploids, each generation would have double the chromosomes of the previous
24. With your group write a statement to explain the origin of the chromosomes found in the zygote. Your statement must include the term homologous pair.
	- Half from the sperm and the other half from the egg
25. At which stage of meiosis are the chromosomes in Model 4?
	- Crossing over in meiosis 1 (metaphase)
26. When the chromosomes come together as homologous pairs, the arms of the sister chromatids may cross over.
	1. What are these crossover points called?
		- Chiasma
	2. Describe what happens to the chromatids during crossover
		- It swaps genetic information, randomizing its contents
27. What phrase is used to describe the chromatids after crossing over takes place and the homologous chromosomes separate?
	- Recombinant chromatids
28. Compare the recombinant chromatids with the original pair
	1. Are the genes on a recombinant chromatid the same as the original chromatid?
		- No, they are mixed from both
	2. Are the alleles on a recombinant chromatid the same as the original chromatid?
		- No, they are mixed
29. Model 5 is a condensed version of meiosis I. Notice the two possible arrangements of chromosomes in late prophase I. Considering what you know about DNA replication and meiosis, is either arrangement equally likely during the formation of tetrads in late prophase I? Explain.
	- Yes, the order of which the chromosomes line up are completely random.
30. If there were three sets of homologous chromosomes in the cell in Model 5, how many possible arrangements would there be for the tetrads in late prophase I?
	- 4
31. With your group, calculate the number of possible genetic combinations due to independent assortment.
	- 2^22
32. Meiosis and sexual reproduction each lead to variation in the genetic make-up of every person. With your group, explain how meiotic events, as well as the random fertilization of eggs and sperm, together lead to this genetic variation.
