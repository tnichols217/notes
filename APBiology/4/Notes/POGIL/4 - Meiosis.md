1. According to Model 1, in what type of organs are the cells that enter meiosis I found?
2. Considering what you already know about mitosis in cells, what event must take place during interphase before a cell proceeds to division?
3. What two structures make up a single replicated chromosome?
4. In Model 1, how many replicated chromosomes does the cell contain during prophase?
5. At which stage in meiosis I do the pairs of homologous chromosomes come together?
6. Once the chromosomes have formed a pair, what are they called?
7. At the end of meiosis I, two cells have been produced. How many replicated chromosomes are in each of these cells?
8. Cells with a full set of chromosomes are referred to as diploid or 2n, whereas cells with half the chromosomes are haploid or n. At which stage(s) of meiosis I are the cells diploid and at which stage(s) are they haploid?
