1. According to Model 1, in what type of organs are the cells that enter meiosis I found?
2. Considering what you already know about mitosis in cells, what event must take place during interphase before a cell proceeds to division?
3. What two structures make up a single replicated chromosome?
4. In Model 1, how many replicated chromosomes does the cell contain during prophase?
5. At which stage in meiosis I do the pairs of homologous chromosomes come together?
6. Once the chromosomes have formed a pair, what are they called?
7. At the end of meiosis I, two cells have been produced. How many replicated chromosomes are in each of these cells?
8. Cells with a full set of chromosomes are referred to as diploid or 2n, whereas cells with half the chromosomes are haploid or n. At which stage(s) of meiosis I are the cells diploid and at which stage(s) are they haploid?
9. Which of the statements below correctly describes the relationship between the cells at the end of telophase I and the original cell?
10. Considering the genetic makeup of the homologous pairs, will the cells at the end of telophase I be genetically identical to each other?
11. According to Model 2, where did each of the cells come from that started meiosis II?
12. In meiosis I, during anaphase I, which structures separated—homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids?
13. In meiosis II, during anaphase II, which structures separated—homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids?
14. At the end of the meiosis II are four daughter cells. Are they haploid or diploid? Explain your answer in a complete sentence.
15. Which of the statements below correctly describes the relationship between the cells at the end of meiosis II and the original cell?
16. According to Model 3, what is the name given to the cells produced at the end of meiosis I in males?
17. What is the name given to the cells produced at the end of meiosis I in females?
18. Refer to Model 3.
	1. At the end of meiosis II in males, what cells are produced?
	2. What do these cells (from the previous question) eventually become?
19. Before fertilization, what happens to the secondary oocyte?
20. During fertilization which two cells come together? Be specific in your answer.
21. During meiosis II, the secondary oocyte divides unevenly, with one cell (the ovum) receiving half of the chromosomes and nearly all the cytoplasm and organelles, while the other cell, the polar body, is much smaller and eventually degenerates. With your group, propose an explanation to explain why the secondary oocyte divides in this way.
22. What is the ploidy of the zygote produced by fertilization—haploid or diploid?
23.
