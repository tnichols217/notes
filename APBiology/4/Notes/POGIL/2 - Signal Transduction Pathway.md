1. According to Model 1, does the signal transduction pathway occur inside or outside of a cell?
2. Compare the shape of the ligand in Model 1 to the shape of the receptor protein
3. The four steps in the signal transduction pathway are listed below. Label the diagram above with the Roman numerals to indicate where on the diagram each step is taking place.
	1. Signaling
	2. Reception
	3. Transduction
	4. Response
4. Based on the diagram in Model 1 and your labels, propose a definition for “transduction” in the context of the signal transduction pathway
5. Amplification often occurs during the transduction step in the signal transduction pathway.
6.
