1. According to Model 1, does the signal transduction pathway occur inside or outside of a cell?
	- Inside
2. Compare the shape of the ligand in Model 1 to the shape of the receptor protein
	- They match perfectly so that the receptor can properly receive the ligand
3. The four steps in the signal transduction pathway are listed below. Label the diagram above with the Roman numerals to indicate where on the diagram each step is taking place.
	1. Signaling
		- The Ligand outside of the cell
	2. Reception
		- The receptor on the membrane
	3. Transduction
		- The Relay proteins
	4. Response
		- The big stars after the proteins
4. Based on the diagram in Model 1 and your labels, propose a definition for “transduction” in the context of the signal transduction pathway
	- Conversion
5. Amplification often occurs during the transduction step in the signal transduction pathway.
	1. Define “amplification” as it is used in everyday language.
		- Multiplication and Boosting
	2. Explain how the signal in Model 1 was amplified.
		- When it went from relay protein 1, it went to 3 of the relay protein 2
6. List several possible responses that could occur due to a signal being received by a cell. (Hint: There are several listed in the Why? box.)
	- A gene is turned on
	- A protein is manufactured
	- An enzyme is activated
	- Cell divides or dies
7. Once the response is achieved in a cell, what would need to occur to stop the response?
	- Stop the signalling and either destroy or inhibit the enzymes that were produced
8. Refer to Model 2. Describe the event that sets off a phosphorylation cascade inside of a cell.
	- Reception of the ligand
9. **Phosphorylation** is a process that adds a phosphate group onto a protein to “activate” it—that is, to change its shape enough that it can function properly.
	1. Which step(s) in the phosphorylation cascade illustrated in Model 2 include phosphorylation?
		- 4 and 5
	2. Where do the phosphate groups come from that are added to the proteins during phosphorylation?
		- From the ATP becoming ADP
10. According to Model 2, what class of enzymes performs phosphorylation?
	- Protein kinases
11. Identify the steps in Model 2 that represent reception, transduction, and response for the phosphorylation pathway
	1. Reception
		- 1
	2. Transduction
		- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
	3. Response
		- 7
12. What is the cell’s response to the signal received in Model 2?
	- Transcribing a part of the DNA
13. In Model 2, steps 3, 4, and 5 are shown as amplification steps. Describe what that means in terms of this signal transduction pathway example.
	- One signal would produce multiple signals, meaning it would increase the effect of a single signal
14. What advantage would there be to an organism if the signal transduction pathway had several amplification steps?
	- It would be harder for a signal to accidentally go unnoticed, it is more likely to be acted upon
15. Describe what would occur in the cell if the activated protein kinase enzymes continued to be active for a long period of time.
	- The signals would be highly concentrated and would activate a lot of other functions
16. What would need to occur in the cell to deactivate the protein kinase enzymes?
	- Dephosphorylation or inhibitors
17. Protein phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins. Complete the illustration in Model 2 by adding at least two protein phosphatases (PP) to show how the cell is returned to inactive status.
	- The PPs will remove the phosphate group from all activated proteins produced in steps 4 and 5
18. Although signal transduction pathways vary among species, there are several common elements. Explain how a biologist might use details about signal transduction pathways used in different species as evidence for evolutionary relatedness.
	- If they share similar signals and receptors to produce the same cellular response, it is highly unlikely that they evolved separately from each other
19. Consider the signal transduction pathway in Model 3. What event begins the process of producing a cellular response?
	- Reception of the signal
20. Locate the secondary messenger molecules in Model 3.
	1. Describe the type of diffusion that is used to get the secondary messengers into the cell.
		- Facilitated diffusion
	2. What activates or opens the transport protein channel that allows the secondary messengers to enter the cell?
		- The active relay protein from the receptor
21. Within an organism it is critical that signals between cells are very specific. For example, if ligand A is meant to activate immune system cells to reproduce in response to an infection, it should not also cause other cells to grow as if they had received a growth hormone. When a ligand is released, what prevents all of the cells in the body from being affected?
	- Not all cells have the matching receptor for this specific signal
