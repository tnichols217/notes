1. Describe specific examples of each of the following ways that cells can communicate with each other:  
	1. No distance
	2. Short distance
	3. Long distance
	4. Local regulators
2. Describe a signal transduction pathway. Â Create an illustration that represents what one of these might look like, and describe the three major steps that occur in this pathway that allow communication to occur.
3. Explain the relationship between the following components of a signal transduction pathway:  
	1. Ligand (first messenger)  
	2. Receptor  
	3. Second messenger
4. Compare the actions in a signal transduction pathway to making a phone call. How are these two things alike?
5. Describe how signal information is transduced into cellular responses in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
6. Describe how it is possible for a single molecule of epinephrine to cause a cell to release thousands of molecules of glucose from glycogen during the fight or flight response
7. Explain how a crowd cheering at a football game is like quorum sensing in bacteria.
8. Explain how mutations can affect signal transduction pathways.
9. Describe how chemicals can inhibit or activate a signal pathway.
10. Create a t-chart that compares and contrasts positive and negative feedback loops.
11. Using the diagram below, explain why the regulation of blood sugar is an example of a negative feedback loop.
