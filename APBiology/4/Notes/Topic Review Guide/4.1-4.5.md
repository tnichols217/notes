1. Describe specific examples of each of the following ways that cells can communicate with each other:  
	1. No distance
		- Directly through gap junctions
	2. Short distance
		- Signals can get sent out quickly and into the new cell
	3. Long distance
		- Signals get sent through the bloodstream
	4. Local regulators
		- When signals effect the cells in the vicinity
2. Describe a signal transduction pathway. Â Create an illustration that represents what one of these might look like, and describe the three major steps that occur in this pathway that allow communication to occur.
	- Reception, Transduction, and Response
3. Explain the relationship between the following components of a signal transduction pathway:  
	1. Ligand (first messenger)
		- The thing that gets recepted
	2. Receptor  
		- The thing that recieves the receptor and sets something else off
	3. Second messenger
		- The thing that goes and activates later parts of the chain often through oxidative phosphorylation
4. Compare the actions in a signal transduction pathway to making a phone call. How are these two things alike?
	- It goes through so many different steps, and if any of the chain is broken the whole chain is broken
5. Describe how signal information is transduced into cellular responses in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
	- Often proteins are phosphorylated which activated their active site in order to produce something
6. Describe how it is possible for a single molecule of epinephrine to cause a cell to release thousands of molecules of glucose from glycogen during the fight or flight response
	- A protein that has been phosphorylated, which is probably an enzyme can produce many molecules, not just one
7. Explain how a crowd cheering at a football game is like quorum sensing in bacteria.
	- Imagine everyone is blind. If everyone cheers, you can guess the amount of people around you from the volume of the cheers. Same for quorum sensing, everyone emits a certain signal, and when there is enough of that signal you know there are a lot of other people around
8. Explain how mutations can affect signal transduction pathways.
	- A mutation in a secondary messenger could probably mess up the whole chain, making it completely ineffective. Alternatively the mutation may create a different product, having different effects on the cell.
9. Describe how chemicals can inhibit or activate a signal pathway.
	- chemicals can inhibit enzymes and prevent them from doing things, and some enzymes can only be activated when phosphorylated
10. Create a t-chart that compares and contrasts positive and negative feedback loops.
	- negative feedback loops balance out at a certain concentration, while positive ones just keep on going out of control
11. Using the diagram below, explain why the regulation of blood sugar is an example of a negative feedback loop. ![[Pasted image 20221211000414.png]]
	- When its too high, it gets taken out, while when it is too low, more gets put in
