1. The figure above represents a generalized hormone-signaling pathway. Briefly explain the role of each numbered step in regulating target gene expression.
	1. Reception - The signalling molecule is received and the chain propagates
	2. Transduction - The signal gets set down the chain by modifying proteins and enzymes and what they produce by either inhibiting them, phophorylating them, or modifying their characteristics
	3. Response - The end of the chain is carried out (often production or destruction of a certain molecule)
