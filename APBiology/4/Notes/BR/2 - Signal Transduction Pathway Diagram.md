1. **Describe** the type of molecule the receptor in this model most likely is composed of.
	- Proteins
2. **Predict** what would happen if the receptor molecule’s shape were to be changed in some way.
	- It would not bind to the signal molecule and the chain would not be activate
3. **Explain** how the transduction process here is like a set of dominoes that fall.
	- If one is missing then the whole chain doesn't work at all
4. **Describe** a cellular response that could be elicited from this type of signaling pathway.
	- Production of glycogen from glucose
