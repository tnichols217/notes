# Interphase

-   Chromosomes are threadlike as DNA is unwound so that genes can be transcribed.
-   Nucleolus is visible
-   DNA replicates, making two identical copies of itself.

# Prophase

-   Chromosomes coil up and shorten, becoming visible…
-   … each chromosome consists of two copies called chromatids which are joined at a centromere
-   Centrioles move to opposite sides of nucleus and spindle fibres start to form
-   Nuclear membrane breaks down at end of prophase.

# Metaphase

-   Chromosomes line up along the equator of the spindle

# Telophase & Cytokinesis

-   Spindle breaks down
-   Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reform in each daughter cell
-   Chromosomes unwind
-   Cytoplasm constricts to form two separate daughter cells (Cytokinesis).
