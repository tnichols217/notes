# Telophase & Cytokinesis

-   Spindle breaks down
-   Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reform in each daughter cell
-   Chromosomes unwind
-   Cytoplasm constricts to form two separate daughter cells (Cytokinesis).

# Anaphase

-   Daughter chromatids are drawn by the centromeres.
-   Chromatids move along the spindle towards opposite ends of the cell.

# Interphase

-   Chromosomes are threadlike as DNA is unwound so that genes can be transcribed.
-   Nucleolus is visible
-   DNA replicates, making two identical copies of itself.
