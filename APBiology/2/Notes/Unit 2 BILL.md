3. Almost the same, except plant cells additionally have a wall and chloroplasts.

## 2.2 and 2.10
1. 1
	1. No energy will be able to be produced and the cell will not be able to go through with its cellular functions
	2. The cell will deflate and itll be hard to transport molecules between the organelles
	3. Larger molecules will not be transported in the cell
2. 2
	1. Helps produce and process complicated proteins
	2. Processes and packages proteins
	3. Cleans up products that will not be needed later
3. Keeps different functions separate so that they do not interfere with each other
4. It protects processed from unwanted molecules by not allowing it to ever reach that enzyme
5. It relies on a high gradient, which could not be done without its own membranes
6. It is easier to create a gradient in a smaller area rather than a large area

## 2.3
1. The smaller they are the easier it is for materials to be transported between cells because of the higher SA:V ratio. It cannot be too small because then there will not be enough space to hold the organelles and transport molecules between the organelles
2. 0.25, it has the highest SA:V ratio
3. It can transport molecules in and out of the cell faster
4. 4
	1. Increase in efficiency of transporting in and out of the cell, but not within
	2. Increase SA:V ratio, but would be hard to maintain its structure
	3. Would be more efficient within the cell, but would waste more energy
5. 5
	1. Smaller cells
	2. Smaller cells
	3. Smaller cells

## 2.4 and 2.5
1. It allows the transmittance of small polar molecules while it repels everything else
2. They create things, offer stability, block things, and protect things
3. Helps hold it together
4. Offers structure for it
5. It can move and flow very easily while keeping things out
6. They are small and have channels
7. 7
	1. Eukaryote, photosynthetic
	2. Photosynthetic, Eukaryote
	3. Prokaryotes, nonphotosynthetic

## 2.7 and 2.9
1. 1
	1. Both transport molecules across the membrane
	2. Passive transports from high to low and does not use a protein
	3. Active transports from low to high and uses a protein to help
2. 2
	1. All transport large amounts of molecules in and out of the cell
	2. Endo goes in
	3. Exo goes out
	4. Receptor mediated also requires a molecule to bind to a receptor to begin endocytosis
3. It could happen passively, but could also happen with the help of a protein to complete something
4. Other molecules that cannot passively diffuse through the membrane need a protein to make a hole in the membrane to allow it to enter the cell
5. Without active transport, molecules will always flow down the gradient, leading everything to eventually flow to equilibrium. With active transport, we can pump them against the gradient to create a stronger gradient
6. ATP is what fuels the protein pumps to move molecules across the membrane

## 2.8
1. It depends on the concentration of different substances in the water, water will flow from high to low osmolarity (low concentration of solute to high)
2. 2
	1. Hypertonic have more solute than another solution
	2. Hypotonic have less solute than another solution
	3. Isotonic have equal
3. Hypertonic solutions around a plant will actually suck water out of the organism. Hypotonic solutions would force more water into the plants.
4. $\Psi=\Psi_0+\Psi_\pi+\Psi_p+\Psi_s+\Psi_v+\Psi_m$
	1. Where 0 is the reference potential
	2. $\pi$ is the solute potential given by $\Psi_\pi=-MiRT$
	3. p is pressure
	4. s is gravity
	5. v is humidity
	6. m is surface tension and cohesion and other fluid effects

## 2.11
1. Eukaryotes have a membrane around the nucleus and the mitochondria, while the prokaryotes do not (but yes for mitochondria if they have a variant of that)
2. Mitochondria may have been its own cell at one point, but gotten incorporated into another cell at some point, explaining its own membrane. Chloroplasts are similar.
3. They have their own membranes and mitochondria has its own genetic information.
4. They are effectively the same, except they are inside another cell now (with minor modifications).

# Unit Summary
## Standards
- 2B1: Cell Membranes are selectively permeable due to their structures.
- 2B2: Growth and dynamic homeostasis are maintained by the constant movement of molecules across membranes.
- 2B3: Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell into specialized regions.
- 4A3: The structure and function of subcellular components, and their interactions, provide essential cellular processes.
- 1B1: Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today.
- 1D1:  There are several hypotheses about the natural origin of life on earth, each with supporting scientific evidence.

## Objectives
1. Be able to discuss the evolution of cells including the endosymbiont theory.
2. Be able to differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells according to the types of organelles are contained in each and in which organisms.
3. Be able to identify the differences between plant and animal cells (organelles).
4. Be able to diagram the structure of the cell membrane and discuss its function.
5. Be able to discuss the principles of osmosis and diffusion in plant and animal cells.
6. Be able to explain the difference between active and passive transport.
7. Be able to discuss and give examples of endocytosis and exocytosis in cells.

## Essential Questions
- How do shared conserved cellular processes support the idea that all organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry? 
  
  Its highly unlikely that two unrelated processes will create exactly equal processes.
  
- How do cells create and maintain internal environments that are different from their external environments? 
  
  Membranes and selective diffusion. Through passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active diffusion, a cell can control what goes in and out of it.
  
- How do structure and function of subcellular components and their interactions provide essential cellular processes? 
  
  They all rely on each other to complete the actions that the cell needs to survive, grow, and divide
  
- How do cells maintain dynamic homeostasis by the movement of molecules across membranes?
  
  It can pump out excess and let in more if necessary by controlling the diffusion through facilitated diffusion and active transport through cell signalling

## Investigation: Limits on Cell Size

| Cube Size | Surface Area | Volume    | SA:V | Sketch |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1x1x1 cm  | 6 cm$^2$     | 1 cm$^3$  | 6:1  | \[ \]  |
| 2x2x2 cm  | 24 cm $^2$   | 8 cm$^3$  | 3:1  | \[.\]  |
| 3x3x3 cm  | 54 cm$^2$    | 27 cm$^3$ | 2:1  | \[o\]  |

1. As the size increases, the SA:V ratio decreases
2. A larger SA:V ratio is better because it allows speedier diffusion of materials within the cell
3. Different Shapes:

| Shape               | Surface Area | Volume      | SA:V(V)       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Cube                | $6w^2$       | $w^3$       | $6V^{-3}$     |
| Sphere              | $\pi w^2$    | $\pi w^3/6$ | $4.836V^{-3}$ |
| Cylindrical (h=4w)  | $5\pi w^2$   | $\pi w^3$   | $7.323V^{-3}$ |
| Square Prism (h=4w) | $18w^2$      | $4w^3$      | $7.143V^{-3}$ |

4. The Cylinder has the best shape because it has the best surface area to volume ratio with respect to volume at $7.323V^{-3}$

## BR: Cell Size and Surface Area

1.  Which of these statements accurately reflects the relationship between cell size and surface area?
    -  Larger cells are most efficient at transporting materials across the membrane since their surface area is increased.
    -  Smaller cells must have more phospholipids per area in order to adequately transport materials into the cell.
    -  Cells must maximize their surface area to volume ratio in order to maintain homeostasis.
    -  Cells must minimize their surface area exposure to the extracellular matrix in order to retain cytosol.

6. Green (0 mol)

![[Pasted image 20221003131321.png]]

#### Analysis
As the concentration of the solution increases, it can be seen that the mass difference decreases. At 0 mol concentration, the mass can be seen to increase, but at 1 mol, the mass can be seen to decrease the most of out all the solutions in the test.

As the concentration of the solution increases, it decreases it water potential, making it more likely that it would be hypertonic in comparison to the insides of the plant tissue, pulling water out of the plant tissue. If the concentration is 0, then it increases its water potential, making it more likely to be hypotonic in comparison to the plant tissue, pushing water into the plant tissue. Since we can assume that the water potential of the plant tissue is constant due to it being the same plant, and same part of the plant, we can conclude that the change in mass can be attributed to the difference in concentration of the sucrose solution.

### Conclusions
We conclude that as you increase the solution concentration surrounding plant tissue, more water will be sucked out of the plant tissue as the solution becomes more hypertonic, decreasing its water potential. As the water potential decreases, it steepens the water potential gradient, pulling more water out of the tissue.

17. Nucleolus
    Where the components of the ribosome are synthesized and assembled; found in the nucleus
    
## BR: prokaryote vs eukaryote
1. Eukaryote - has a nucleus
2. Eukaryote - has a nucleus
3. Prokaryote - it doesn't have a nucleus

## BR: cell membrane labeling

## Activity: diffusion and osmosis challenge

1. False, it will become more concentrated because the concentrations will balance with respect to water and glucose
2. True, although the amount of glucose cannot change, the percentage of glucose would change because the volume on each side could change
3. False, side X will eventually equal double of side Y because of the concentrations of glucose, which cannot change. 
4. False The amount of Glucose stays the same, but the percentage with respect to volume will obviously change
5. False, it will move to make the ratios equal, meaning it will go to the side with more glucose
6. True
7. False, it moves towards the side with lower water concentration
8. False, it is a random process and water will move both ways, but it will move in NET to side X
9. True
10. False, the left has lower potential
