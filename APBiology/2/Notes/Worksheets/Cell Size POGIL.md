# Cell Size
1. They are Animal Cells because they lack chloroplasts and don't have cell walls
2. -
3. 3
	1. Cell B
	2. Cell B
4. 4
	1. Cell B
	2. 
5. The cell would not get enough nutrients and resources, so it will fail to replicate and die
6. 6
	1. Cell B
	2. Smaller, everything is on average closer to the membranes
	3. Smaller, there is a higher surface area to volume ratio
7. No, smaller cells can do stuff faster
8. 8
	1. Cube
	2. Sphere
	3. Cylinder

  | **Cube**          |       |       |       |
  | ----------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
  | Side              | 1     | 2     | 4     |
  | Surface Area      | 6     | 24    | 96    |
  | Volume            | 1     | 8     | 64    |
  | SA:V              | 6:1   | 3:1   | 1.5:1 |
  | **Sphere**        |       |       |       |
  | Diameter          | 1     | 2     | 4     |
  | Surface Area      | 3     | 13    | 50    |
  | Volume            | 0.5   | 4.2   | 34    |
  | SA:V              | 6:1   | 3.1:1 | 1.5:1 |
  | **Cylinder**      |       |       |       |
  | Diameter x Height | 1 x 1 | 1 x 2 | 1 x 4 |
  | Surface Area      | 4.7   | 7.9   | 14    |
  | Volume            | 0.8   | 1.6   | 3.1   |
  | SA:V              | 5.9:1 | 4.9:1 | 4.5:1 |
10. 10
	1. The surface area increases by 4x, but not as fast as the volume
	2. The volume increases by 8x, faster than the surface area
	3. Volume
11. 11 (skipped?)
12. 12
13. The volume always increases faster than the surface area, leading the SA:V ratio to decrease as the shape increases in size
14. Higher ratio, so that things can be transported faster
15. 14
	1. No
	2. The Cylinder
16. Cylinders, as it keeps the SA:V ratio high while maintaining its larger size
17. 17
	1. Cylinders
	2. Cylinders
	3. Large Spheres
	4. Small Cubes
	5. Small Spheres
18. They are unicellular, so all the functions of the organism needs to be carried out by the singular cell. Multicellular organisms may have multiple jobs for different cells, meaning each cell can be more specialised, allowing them to be smaller and more efficient.
