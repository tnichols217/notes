# Unit Summary
## Standards
- 2B1: Cell Membranes are selectively permeable due to their structures.
- 2B2: Growth and dynamic homeostasis are maintained by the constant movement of molecules across membranes.
- 2B3: Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell into specialized regions.
- 4A3: The structure and function of subcellular components, and their interactions, provide essential cellular processes.
- 1B1: Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely distributed among organisms today.
- 1D1:  There are several hypotheses about the natural origin of life on earth, each with supporting scientific evidence.

## Objectives
1. Be able to discuss the evolution of cells including the endosymbiont theory.
2. Be able to differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells according to the types of organelles are contained in each and in which organisms.
3. Be able to identify the differences between plant and animal cells (organelles).
4. Be able to diagram the structure of the cell membrane and discuss its function.
5. Be able to discuss the principles of osmosis and diffusion in plant and animal cells.
6. Be able to explain the difference between active and passive transport.
7. Be able to discuss and give examples of endocytosis and exocytosis in cells.

## Essential Questions
- How do shared conserved cellular processes support the idea that all organisms are linked by lines of descent from common ancestry? 
  
  Its highly unlikely that two unrelated processes will create exactly equal processes.
  
- How do cells create and maintain internal environments that are different from their external environments? 
  
  Membranes and selective diffusion. Through passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active diffusion, a cell can control what goes in and out of it.
  
- How do structure and function of subcellular components and their interactions provide essential cellular processes? 
  
  They all rely on each other to complete the actions that the cell needs to survive, grow, and divide
  
- How do cells maintain dynamic homeostasis by the movement of molecules across membranes?
  
  It can pump out excess and let in more if necessary by controlling the diffusion through facilitated diffusion and active transport through cell signalling

13. The volume always increases faster than the surface area, leading the SA:V ratio to decrease as the shape increases in size

As you increase the cube size, more sides of the mini-cubes are covered up
```
```col-md
The larger it is, the more mini-cube covered sides there are, meaning the overall large-cube surface area is significantly less than that of small-cubes

## Investigation: Limits on Cell Size

| Cube Size | Surface Area | Volume    | SA:V | Sketch |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1x1x1 cm  | 6 cm$^2$     | 1 cm$^3$  | 6:1  | \[ \]  |
| 2x2x2 cm  | 24 cm $^2$   | 8 cm$^3$  | 3:1  | \[.\]  |
| 3x3x3 cm  | 54 cm$^2$    | 27 cm$^3$ | 2:1  | \[o\]  |

1. As the size increases, the SA:V ratio decreases
2. A larger SA:V ratio is better because it allows speedier diffusion of materials within the cell
3. Different Shapes:

| Shape               | Surface Area | Volume      | SA:V(V)       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Cube                | $6w^2$       | $w^3$       | $6V^{-3}$     |
| Sphere              | $\pi w^2$    | $\pi w^3/6$ | $4.836V^{-3}$ |
| Cylindrical (h=4w)  | $5\pi w^2$   | $\pi w^3$   | $7.323V^{-3}$ |
| Square Prism (h=4w) | $18w^2$      | $4w^3$      | $7.143V^{-3}$ |

4. The Cylinder has the best shape because it has the best surface area to volume ratio with respect to volume at $7.323V^{-3}$

## BR: Cell Size and Surface Area

1.  Which of these statements accurately reflects the relationship between cell size and surface area?
    -  Larger cells are most efficient at transporting materials across the membrane since their surface area is increased.
    -  Smaller cells must have more phospholipids per area in order to adequately transport materials into the cell.
    -  Cells must maximize their surface area to volume ratio in order to maintain homeostasis.
    -  Cells must minimize their surface area exposure to the extracellular matrix in order to retain cytosol.
