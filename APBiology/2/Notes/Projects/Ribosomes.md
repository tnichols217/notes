## Phamplet
- catchy graphics and details as to the structure and function of the organelle
- well organized and easy for the voter to follow
- not to have long paragraphs of information
- relate the structure of the organelle to its function
- why your organelle is important for survival of the organism
- detailed about the jobs it performs to survival of the organism. Can you link the organelle to survival of an ecosystem? The whole entire world? Okay, maybe this is a little dramatic, but that is how campaigns can be. Can you find quotes from doctors or other experts? Can you find dramatic pictures and examples? Can you explain what life would be like without your organelle? Can you make campaign promises â€“ what will you guarantee life will be like with your organelle as the most important?
