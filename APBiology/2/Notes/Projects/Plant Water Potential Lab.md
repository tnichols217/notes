# Water Potential Lab
## Objective
See how different concentrations of a liquid effects the process of osmosis by measuring the amount of water moved in or out of some plant tissue over time.

## Materials
- Carrots / Potatoes (plant tissue), equally cubed
- 6 glycosidic solutions with differing concentrations

### Tools
- Scale
- Knive / Scapel
- Chopping board
- Storage containers

## Procedure
1. The plant tissue was prepared by cubing it into equal sized cubes
2. The cubes were equally divided into containers
3. The weight of the plant tissue of each container was measured
4. an equal sufficient amount of glycosidic solution into each container was measured out, with differing concentrations for each container
5. Each container's concentration was noted down
6. 24 hours passed
7. The mass of the plant tissue after it has submerged for sufficient time was remeasured
8. The percentage change in the mass of the plant tissue was calculated
9. The concentrations with the percent change in mass were calculated
10. Conclusions were drawn

### Analysis
As the concentration of the solution increases, it can be seen that the mass difference decreases. At 0 mol concentration, the mass can be seen to increase, but at 1 mol, the mass can be seen to decrease the most of out all the solutions in the test.

As the concentration of the solution increases, it decreases it water potential, making it more likely that it would be hypertonic in comparison to the insides of the plant tissue, pulling water out of the plant tissue. If the concentration is 0, then it increases its water potential, making it more likely to be hypotonic in comparison to the plant tissue, pushing water into the plant tissue. Since we can assume that the water potential of the plant tissue is constant due to it being the same plant, and same part of the plant, we can conclude that the change in mass can be attributed to the difference in concentration of the sucrose solution.

## Conclusions
We conclude that as you increase the solution concentration surrounding plant tissue, more water will be sucked out of the plant tissue as the solution becomes more hypertonic, decreasing its water potential. As the water potential decreases, it steepens the water potential gradient, pulling more water out of the tissue.
