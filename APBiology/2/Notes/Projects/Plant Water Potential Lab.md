# Water Potential Lab
## Objective
See how different concentrations of a liquid effects the process of osmosis by measuring the amount of water moved in or out of some plant tissue over time.

## Materials
- Carrots / Potatoes (plant tissue), equally cubed
- 6 glycosidic solutions with differing concentrations

### Tools
- Scale
- Knive / Scapel
- Chopping board
- Storage containers

## Procedure
1. Prepare the plant tissue by cubing it into equal sized cubes
2. Equally divide the cubes into containers
3. Measure the weight of the plant tissue of each container
4. Measure out an equal sufficient amount of glycosidic solution into each container, with differing concentrations for each container
5. Note down which container has which concentration
6. Wait 24h
7. Remeasure the mass of the plant tissue after it has submerged for sufficient time
8. Calculate the percentage change in the mass of the plant tissue
9. Compare the concentrations with the percent change in mass
10. Draw conclusions

Change from least mass change to most mass change:
1. Red (1 mol)
2. Purple (0.8 mol)
3. Blue (0.6 mol)
4. Yellow (0.4 mol)
5. Orange (0.2 mol)
6. Green (0 mol)

### Analysis
As the concentration of the solution increases, it can be seen that the mass difference decreases. At 0 mol concentration, the mass can be seen to increase, but at 1 mol, the mass can be seen to decrease the most of out all the solutions in the test.

As the concentration of the solution increases, it decreases it water potential, making it more likely that it would be hypertonic in comparison to the insides of the plant tissue, pulling water out of the plant tissue. If the concentration is 0, then it increases its water potential, making it more likely to be hypotonic in comparison to the plant tissue, pushing water into the plant tissue. Since we can assume that the water potential of the plant tissue is constant due to it being the same plant, and same part of the plant, we can conclude that the change in mass can be attributed to the difference in concentration of the sucrose solution.

## Conclusions
We conclude that as you increase the solution concentration surrounding plant tissue, more water will be sucked out of the plant tissue as the solution becomes more hypertonic, decreasing its water potential. As the water potential decreases, it steepens the water potential gradient, pulling more water out of the tissue.
