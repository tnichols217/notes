| Bottleneck effect     | Small populations are at higher risk for random genetic factors                                                      |
| Genetic drift         |                                                                                                                      |
| Founder effect        |                                                                                                                      |
| Natural selection     | Differential reproductive success; ‘survival of the fittest’                                                         |
| Disruptive selection  |                                                                                                                      |
| Directional selection |                                                                                                                      |
| Artificial selection  | Brassica oleracea can be bred to create a host of vegetable types such as broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts |
| Stabilizing selection |                                                                                                                      |
