| Bottleneck effect     | Small populations are at higher risk for random genetic factors                                                      |
| Genetic drift         | Cheetahs have little genetic variation due to dwindling populations                                                  |
| Founder effect        | Dutch-descended S. Africans have a high rate of Huntington’s disease                                                 |
| Natural selection     | Differential reproductive success; ‘survival of the fittest’                                                         |
| Disruptive selection  |                                                                                                                      |
| Directional selection |                                                                                                                      |
| Artificial selection  | Brassica oleracea can be bred to create a host of vegetable types such as broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts |
| Stabilizing selection | A tendency for a population mean to also become the mode                                                             |
| Gene flow             | New individuals migrate to an island bringing their own genes                                                        |
