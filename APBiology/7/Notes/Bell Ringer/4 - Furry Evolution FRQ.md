1. The left bump (light color) would likely move to the right over time and decrease as the non-mutated would die out until the graph would no longer look bimodal. This would happen because the environment that pressured for light colored fur would no longer exist and would turn rocky over time, pressuring the mice to have dark colored fur instead
2. (Just chop off the left bump)
3. It selects for darker fur color. The alleliic frequencies would tend towards dark fur in the population over time
