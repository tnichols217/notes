## Procedure

1. 1
   1. Fur color through melanism
   2. Dark are more likely to survive in a dark environment and the same is true for light in light
   3. Frequencies in dark colored mice are in part governed by the MC1R gene
2. -

## Part 1

1. $q = 0.5$ because $q^2=4/16=0.25$ therefore $q=0.5$
2. $q=0.4$ because $p+q=1$ and $p=0.6$
3. $p^2=0.04$ because $q^2=640/1000=0.64\therefore q=0.8$ and $p+q=1\therefore p=0.2$

## Part 2
1. Light = $120/168=71\%$ and Dark = $48/169=20\%$
2. Light = $3/57=5\%$ and Dark = $54/57=95\%$
3. 3
	1. $dd=71\%$
	2. $Dd=26\%$
	3. $DD=3\%$
4. 4
	1. $dd=5\%$
	2. $Dd=34\%$
	3. $DD=61\%$
5. Dark colored, as on the light colored ground, there is still a whole 20% of dark colored mice, whilst on the dark ground, there is only 5% light colored mice.
