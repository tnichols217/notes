> > The variation in the trait of interest is at least partially inherited (passed from parents to offspring). The variation stems from random mutations and the recombination that accompanies sexual reproduction. The genetic variation may have arisen many generations in the past.

> > More offspring are born than can survive, resulting in competition among individuals within a population. Some individuals with a particular trait are more likely to survive and/or have relatively more offspring compared to individuals that do not have that trait. Selection depends on the specific context of a species. Traits that are beneficial in one environment may cause problems in another environment.
