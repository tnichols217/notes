## Questions
1. Having color-matched fur with mice and their environment gives them an environmental advantage as they are harder to prey on when harder to spot. Light fur on light sand is an advantage and dark on dark is too, but a mismatch of colors will make them stick out in their environment.
2. 2
	1. It contains four mutations
	2. They do not have the mutation and the amino acid sequence is the same as the light color's, yet they still display dark fur.
	3. This shows that they have evolved the same phenotype through different genetic mutations. This also shows that some mutations or evolution are repeatable.
3. This is a theory that says the mutations that give a certain population an environment
