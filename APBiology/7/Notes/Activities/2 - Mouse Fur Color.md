	1. Since we have previously established that menanism is quite a common mutation, it is also likely to have happened to atleast some of the population of rock pocket mice in this area, meaning that a dark fur phenotype exists in this population. Melaninism is also a genetically inherited trait, meaning that such mutations can be passed down to children. Since there is a nearby environment with dark surroundings (the dark rocks) the dark fur of the dark fur mutation mice will have a higher chance of surviving in the area because they will be harder to spot and predate upon. This will give a natural selective pressure towards the darker furred mice. Over time, with this selective pressure, most of the mice living on the dark rocks will have the dark fur.
	2. Needed to, they don't really have influence on whether they want dark fur or not, unless it is seen as a reproductive advantage to these mice and would lead them to increase likelihood of mating. But in this examples, mice probably would not know that they should be self breeding to produce black mice, and instead natural pressures such as predation are more likely to push the population to have darker fur.

	2. Only the Tule Well, Lava (East), and the O'Neill Pass. this is more likely because the sample size for these populations are larger
	3. Variation, this shows that in a larger population there will likely be genetic variation within the population. Additionally, this shows the effects of natural selection through selective fitness, because similar skinned furs hold a higher percentage in their respective environments.
8. Fur color is effected by the genotype of the MC1R gene. Additionally, the more of allele 2 there are, the more likely the mouse is to have dark fur. Heterozygous mice tend to have fur inbetween light and dark on average.
	1. Yes, since there is a significant difference between the strata, this shows that the fur color is in part governed by this gene and is therefore inherited. The spread of each strata is miniscule compared to the differences in percent reflectance across strata.
9. *Figure 4* shows a correlation between the frequency of the MC1R allale 2 and frequency of black mice in a population by comparing it to *Figure 2*. Their visual similarities - the similar peaks in dark mice with peaks in allele 2 frequency show that there is a correlation between the two. Since we know that having dark fur cannot influence the genetic information of the mice, we can say that the MC1R gene causes in part the dark fur of the mice. This contributes to natural selection because the MC1R allele 2 is inheritable through its genetic code.

## Apply what you learned
1. We would need to collect evidence that proves the claim that light fur is more prevalent in light areas and that dark fur is more prevalent in dark areas. Then we can look for variation across the two populations to see if th
