1. Body size and number of Individuals
2. Directional, Disruptive, and Stabilizing
3. This could be due to random mutation, or having multiple selective environments across the population
4. 4
   1. They are on average heavier
   2. The heavier ones, since they are being selected for
   3. Perhaps the heavier ones have more muscle mass, allowing them to run faster and evade predators or aid in predation
5. 5
   1. The new population will be larger or smaller than the old average, but not the old average
   2. Either heavier ones or lighter ones, but not average ones
   3. Heavier ones could have more muscle mass and aid in running away or chasing prey, while lighter ones may be smaller and harder to spot, providing more camo and surprise over prey
6. 6
   1. The new population is closer to the average, meaning the spread of the weight is less
   2. Those of average weight
   3. This could be because heavier ones would be easier to spot and predate upon, and too small would not have muscle mass and cannot evade predators
7. 7
   1. Directional selection means that over time and generations, a particular phenotypic trait - more or less than the current average of that trait - of the population will be selected for as they are more well fit for the environment they fit in.
   2. Disruptive selection means that over time and generations, a particular phenotypic trait of the population will be selected against as they are unfit for the environment they fit in, so phenotypes displaying either more or less of that trait would be selected for instead.
   3. Directional selection means that over time and generations, the current average phenotypic trait of the population will be selected for as they are more well fit for the environment they fit in.
8. 8
   1. Directional, it will select for larger beaks
   2. Stabilizing, as both large and small are unfavorable, so the average will thrive
   3. Disruptive, as there is no "best" for the average, but benefits for those on the outskirts of the trait
   4. Directional, as larger salmons are more likely to be predated upon, so only the smaller ones reproduce
9. AB, CD, EF
10. AB
11. Unable to produce fertile offspring
12. No, all mules are unable to reproduce so their parents - the horse and donkey - are not of the same species
13. No, as they are highly unlikely to mate at all so would li
