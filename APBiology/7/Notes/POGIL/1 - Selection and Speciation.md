1. Body size and number of Individuals
2. Directional, Disruptive, and Stabilizing
3. This could be due to random mutation, or having multiple selective environments across the population
4. 4
	1. They are on average heavier
	2. The heavier ones, since they are being selected for
	3. Perhaps the heavier ones have more muscle mass, allowing them to run faster and evade predators or aid in predation
5. 5
	1. The new population will be larger or smaller than the old average, but not the old average
	2. Either heavier ones or lighter ones, but not average ones
	3. Heavier ones could have more muscle mass and aid in running away or chasing prey, while lighter ones may be smaller and harder to spot, providing more camo and surprise over prey
6. 6
	1. The new population is closer to the average, meaning the spread of the weight is less
	2. Those of average weight
	3. This could be because heavier ones would be easier to spot and predate upon, and too small would not have muscle mass and cannot evade predators
