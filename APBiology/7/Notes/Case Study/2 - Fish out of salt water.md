# Part 1

1. It must be variable across the population, have selective pressure towards a certain size of muscle mass, and be heritable
2. ![[Pasted image 20230413003954.png]]
3. ![[Pasted image 20230413004037.png]]
4. Yes, like energy efficiency, proportions, coat color

# Part 2

1. maybe like 7, because most things should remain similar across the same species but some things would be different due to different environmental pressures
2. ![[APBiology/7/Notes/Case Study/2 - Fish out of salt water/Table 1]]
3. 6.6, no not really
4. about 20
5. I would say it is quite close as it would all tend towards similar phenotypes in a similar environment anyway
6. Less natural selection would happen because there are less things to select from

# Part 3

1. Organelles within the cells of the respective fish, since they may be required to work at different pH levels
2. The genome that would code for the cell walls, or proteins that would aid moving molecules across it, as they may differ in the way they deal with high or low pH molecules
3.
