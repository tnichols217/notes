# Macromolecules
## Polymers vs Monomers
> [!def]
> Macromolecules are made of Polymers

> [!def]
> **Polymers** are made of a chain of Monomers
>> [!def]
>> **Dehydration**: The binding of multiple monomers to form a polymer by removing extra $H_2O$.
>> One monomer loses a $H$ and the other loses an $OH$
>
>> [!def]
>> **Hydrolysis**: The separation of a polymer into its monomers by adding $H_2O$
>> Literally means water separation.
>> One chain receives a $H$ and the other receives an $OH$ (Splitting the added water)

## Carbohydrates
Carbs are sugars and polymers of sugars


### Monosaccharides
>[!def]
> **Monosaccharides**
> Literally means "**single sugar**"
> It is the **monomer** of disaccharides and polysacchrides
> Usually are found multiples of $CH_2O$

### Disaccharides

### Polysaccharides

## Lipids

## Proteins
> [!def]
> **Protein**
> Proteins are made of one or more Polypeptides
> Polypeptides are polymers of Amino Acids (monomers)
> Amino Acids are the Monomer of Proteins.
