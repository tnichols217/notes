# Macromolecules
## Polymers vs Monomers
> [!def]
> **Macromolecules**
> Large structures consisting of one or more Polymer
> ***
> 
> **Polymers**
> Formed by chains of Monomers
> ***
> 
> **Monomers**
> Building blocks of Polymers
> Some have functions of their own
> ***
> 
> **Condensation Reaction**
> The binding of two substances by removing a small molecule.
> ***
> 
> **Dehydration**
> - The **binding** of multiple monomers to form a polymer by **removing** extra $H_2O$.
> - Dehydration is a type of condensation reaction, one where the small molecule being removed is specifically water.
> - One monomer loses a $H$ and the other loses an $OH$
> - Literally means "**To remove** (de-) **water** (hydrate)"
>***
>
> **Hydrolysis**
> - The **separation** of a polymer into its monomers by adding $H_2O$
> - Literally means **water** (hydro) **separation** (lysis).
> - One chain receives a $H$ and the other receives an $OH$ (Splitting the added water)

## The Four Macromolecules
1. [[#Carbohydrates]]
2. [[#Lipids]]
3. [[#Proteins]]
4. [[#Nucleic Acids]]

### Carbohydrates
Carbs are sugars and polymers of sugars
They provide quick energy and also serve as structural support

#### Monosaccharides
>[!def]
> **Monosaccharides**
> Literally means "**single sugar**"
> It is the **monomer** of disaccharides and polysacchrides
> Usually are found multiples of $CH_2O$
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> D-Glucose
> ```
> **D-Glucose** ($C_6H_{12}O_6$), one of the most basic Monomers in real life.

##### Characteristics of a monosaccharide
###### Contains a Carbonyl group ($C=O$)
````col
```molecule3d
Methanone
```
**A carbonyl group**
The Carbon will be bonded to two other atoms
````
###### Contains multiple Hydroxyl groups ($-\ OH$)
````col
```molecule3d
hydroxide
```
**A hydroxyl group**
The Oxygen will normally be bonded to the Carbon Backbone
````

#### Disaccharides
> [!def]
> **Disaccharides**
> Are "**double sugars**", simply two monosaccharides bonded together.

#### Polysaccharides

### Lipids

### Proteins
> [!def]
> **Protein**
> Proteins are made of one or more Polypeptides
> Polypeptides are polymers of Amino Acids (monomers)
> Amino Acids are the Monomer of Proteins.
