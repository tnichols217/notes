### Carbohydrates
There are three kinds of carbohydrates
- [[#Monosaccharides]]
- [[#Disaccharides]]
- [[#Polysaccharides]]

Carbs are sugars (mono and di) and polymers of sugars (poly)
They provide quick energy and also serve as structural support

#### Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides are normally charachterized by the amount of Carbons in the backbone and where the carbonyl group ($C=O$) is located
>[!def]
> **Monosaccharides**
> Literally means "**single sugar**"
> It is the **monomer** of disaccharides and polysacchrides

#### Disaccharides
> [!def]
> **Disaccharides**
> Are "**double sugars**", simply two monosaccharides glycosidically linked together.
> ***
> 
> **Glycosidic Linkage**
> A covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by dehydration.

Disaccharides are normally used as a **mean to transport energy** within an organism.

> [!example]
> `````col
> ````col-md
> **Maltose**
> ```molecule3d
> maltose
> ```
> ```molecule
> maltose
> ```
> Maltose is a disaccharide of two glucose molecules
> ````
> ````col-md
> **Sucrose**
> ```molecule3d
> sucrose
> ```
> ```molecule
> sucrose
> ```
> Surcrose is a disaccharide of a glucose and fructose molecule
> ````
> `````

#### Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are normally characterized by two things
- $\alpha$ or $\beta$ bonding
- Amount of branching

> [!def]
> **Polysaccharides**
> Are long chains of monosaccharides linked with glycosydic bonds

Polysaccharides are normally used to **store energy** and serve as **building material** for organism (like cellulose in a cell wall)

> [!example] 
> **Starch**
> - Plants use starch to store energy (monomers are **$\alpha$ glucose**)
> - Starch tends to be not as branched
> ***
> 
> **Glycogen**
> - Humans store glycogen in muscles to provide energy when needed.
> - Is made from **$\alpha$ glucose**
> - It is extensively branched so that it can be easily broken down when necessary.
> ***
> 
> **Cellulose**
> - Plants use cellulose as a building material to provide structure in the cell wall (monomers are **$\beta$ glucose**)
> - Cellulose is never branched
> - Is hard to digest and most animals cannot break down cellulose to produce usable energy.
> ***
> 
> **Chitin**
> - Insects use Chitin as an exoskeleton due to its strong structure.
> - Uses **$\beta$ chitin** as its monomer, making it hard to digest as well
> ````col
> ```molecule
> N-[(2R)-2,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]acetamide
> ```
> The chitin monomer has a similar structure to cellulose except it contains a nitrogen attachment on the carbon backbone
> ```molecule
> cellulose
> ```
> ````

##### The difference between $\alpha$ Glucose and $\beta$ Glucose
$\alpha$ Glucose will always bond on the same side, while $\beta$ Glucose will bond in alternating patterns.
A similar thing is found for proteins, if bonded like an $\alpha$ then it will form $\alpha$ helices, while $\beta$ bonding will form $\beta pleats.


### Lipids
There are three kinds of Lipids
1. [[#Fats]]
2. [[#Phospholipids]]
3. [[#Steroids]]

> [!def]
> **Lipids**
> - Are a group of macromolecules defined by being hydrophobic
> - Are very diverse
> - Contains a lot of Hydrocarbons ($\text{C}-\text{H}$)
> ***
> 
> **Ester Linkages**
> A bond between a **Hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}$)** and a **Carboxyl group ($\text{COOH}$)**
> Formed by a dehydration reaction
> ***
> 
> **Carboxyl group ($\text{COOH}$)**
> - A group of atoms which is a combination of a **carbonyl group ($\text{C}-\text{O}$)** and a **hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}$)**
> - The bonding will look similar to **$\text{O}-\text{C}-\text{OH}$** where the central carbon will be bonded to something else, often a carbon backbone

#### Fats
Fats are used for:
- **Storing energy**: Organisms store large amounts of energy in the hydrocarbon chains of fats. Fats contain twice the amount of energy for the same weight as compared to Phospholipids.
- **Insulation**: Fats provide insulation from heat or cold as well as protection to vitals in the body.

There are two kinds of Fats
1. [[#Unsaturated Fats]]
2. [[#Saturated Fats]]

> [!def]
> **Fats**
> - A large molecule formed by a dehydration reaction between **Glycerol** and **Fatty Acids**
> - There will always be one glycerol and **three** fatty acids
> - Are sometimes called **Triglycerides** or **Triglycerols** because of the three fatty acids
> - Are Completely nonpolar and hydrophobic
> ***
> 
> **Fatty Acids**
> A carbon skeleton usually **16-18** carbons long ending with a carboxyl group
> These are often referred to as the "tails" of the Fat
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> palmitic acid
> ```
> **Palimitic Acid**
> A common fatty acid that is bonded with glycerol to form a fat.
> Notice the Carboxyl (COOH) on the end
> ````
> ***
> **Glycerol ($C_3H_8O_3$)**
> An alcohol that holds together all the fatty acids to form fats.
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> glycerol
> ```
> **Glycerol**
> Contains three Hydroxyl groups (OH) to ester link with the fatty acids
> ````
> ***
> 
> **Unsaturated Fats**
> - Fats that contain unsaturated fatty acids, which contain double bonds.
> - Often **Liquid** at room temperature due to not being able to pack closely together.
> ***
> 
> **Saturated Fats**
> - Fats of which all their Fatty Acids are saturated and do not contain double bonds and are perfectly straight.
> - Often **Solid** at room temperature due to being space efficient.

##### Unsaturated Fats
Unsaturated Fats' Fatty Acids often contain "kinks" in them from **cis-double bonding** in the carbon skeleton, disallowing them to pack closely, leading them to be liquid at room temperature.

Unsaturated Fats may also contain **trans-double bonding**, classifying these fats as **trans fats**.

> [!def]
> **Cis-double bonding**
> - Happens when two **Carbons are double bonded** and the remaining bonds to these Carbons are on the **same side** of the molecule.
> - Since the other molecules are on the same side of the molecule, it **forces the molecule to bend** in the other direction
> ***
> 
> **Trans-double bonding**
> - Happens when two Carbons are double bonded and the remaining bonds are on **opposite sides** of the molecule.
> - Since the extra bonds are on opposite sides, they balance out and this double bond **does not cause bending** of the molecule.
> ***
> 
> **Trans Fats**
> Saturated Fats of which their Fatty Acids contain trans-double bonding, which may allow them to be straight and unbent.
> Trans Fats have also been linked to coronary heart disease due to blockage of blood vessels

##### Saturated Fats
Saturated Fats' Fatty Acids are completely straight and are called **Hydrogen saturated**, because each carbon in the skeleton is bonded to two Hydrogens as well as two Carbons, disallowing any double bonding from happening in the skeleton (which cause kinks).

Saturated fats have also been linked to negative health side effects, especially with causing issues of blood flow.

> [!def]
> **Hydrogen saturated fatty acid**
> Where every Carbon on a fatty acid's Carbon skeleton is bonded to two Hydrogens, as well as the two neighbouring carbons.
> This allows the fatty acid to be straight as there is no double bonding.

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Tristearin
> ```
> ```col-md
> **<- Tristearin**
> A saturated fat made of three **Stearic acid** fatty acids.
> 
> **Stearic acid ->**
> A saturated fatty acid with a 18C backbone
> ```
> ```molecule3d
> Stearic acid
> ```
> ````

#### Phospholipids
Are used for:
1. Making up the cell membrane

Phospholipids are similar to Fats as they are also made of **glycerol and three connecting molecules**, connected by **Ester Linkages**
When Phospholipids are put in water, they will self assemble into a **bilayer** because of the uneven polarity of the molecules.

Composed of:
1. Glycerol
2. Two Hydrophobic fatty acids tails
3. Phosphate group
4. Occasionally a hydrophilic molecule

> [!example]
> **Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine**
> An example phospholipid that has two bent tails and a hydrophobic head
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine
> ```
> ```col-md
> ![[Pasted image 20220822225335.png]]
> ```
> ````

> [!def]
> **Phospholipid Bilayer**
> A membrane made of **two layers of phospholipids** where the hydrophobic heads are pointing to the surface of the layer and the hydrophobic tails are facing each other on the interior of the layer.
> Looks something like o=|=o where the **o** are the heads and the **=** are the tails.
> ![[Pasted image 20220822225306.png]]

#### Steroids
Lipids that are characterised by their **four fused rings**: three six atom rings then a five atom ring. On the last ring (ring D).
**One fatty acid** is often attached and is called the **functional group** of the steroid

> [!def]
> **Fused Rings**
> Rings of atoms that share a side.
>> [!example]
>> ````col
>> ```molecule3d
>> Decahydronaphthalene
>> ```
>> **Decahydronaphthalene**
>> A molecule consisting of two fused cyclohexane rings
>> ````
>> ````col
>> **Cyclohexane**
>> A molecule consisting of only a ring of 6 carbons and attaching hydrogen
>> ```molecule3d
>> Cyclohexane
>> ```
>> ````

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Gonane
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Gonane**
> The simplest steroid consisting of only three rings of cyclohexane followed by one ring of cyclopentane.
> Gonane has no attached fatty acid or functional group
> ```

> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Cholesterol

> ```col-md
> **Cholesterol**
> A very important steroid of which many other important ones are made from.
