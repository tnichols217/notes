**Water** ($H_2O$) Forms a V shaped molecule with the $H$ ends having a partial positive charge and the $O$ ends having a partial negative charge.

> **Hydrogen Bonding**
> A relatively strong intermolecular force.
> The positive charge of the $H$ is attracted to the negative charges of other molecules. In the case of water, the negative charge is on the $O$ side.

### Cohesion

> [!def]
> **Cohesion**
> The bonds that hold a substance together. 
> 
> In water, Hydrogen bonds act as the cohesion force.
> ***
> **Surface Tension**
> The difficulty of stretching or puncturing the surface of a liquid
> 
> Since water's cohesion force is Hydrogen Bonding (a relatively strong intermolecular force), its surface tension is also high. Additionally, the Hydrogen bonds do *not* bond with the surrounding air, increasing its surface tension
> ***
> **Adhesion**
> The bonds that hold a substance to something else.
> 
> Water also has a relatively strong adhesive force to certain materials because of its polarity and Hydrogen bonding.

#### Cohesion and Surface Tension help support Life
- High surface tension allows things to float easily
- Adhesion allows plants to transport water up its roots and stem against the gravity

### Moderation of Temperature

> [!def]
> **Thermal Energy**
> The *total* amount of kinetic energy a certain amount of particles have.
> The faster the particles move, the more kinetic energy it has, meaning more thermal energy, meaning higher **Temperature**

#### Water's High Specific Heat
Water has a very high Specific Heat in comparison to most other materials. This means that it can absorb a lot of energy before increasing its Temperature. 

For comparison, Water's specific heat is **10x** that of Iron.

#### Water's High Heat of Vaporisation
Water also has a high heat of vaporisation. This allows water to absorb a lot of energy once it is at boiling point before actually changing into a gas.

> [!def]
> **Evaporative Cooling**
> When hotter molecules are more likely to evaporate, leaving the average temperature of the remaining liquid cooler.

#### Water's Moderation of Temperature helps support Life
- Allows water to absorb a lot of energy without gaining a lot of temperature, such as the oceans absorbing a lot of energy from the Sun without heating up throughout the day.
- Allows organisms too cool themselves down with the help of a high heat of vaporisation as well as evaporative cooling.

### Floating of Ice on Water
Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than a liquid. This allows Ice to float on Water. 
![[IceLattice.png]]
When water is locked into this kind of lattice, it has more empty space than when it is a liquid, making it less dense.

#### Floating Ice's importance to Life
- Floating Ice protects ponds and other bodies of water from completely freezing over. Since ice floats, the water remains underneath the ice.

### The Solvent of Life 

> [!def]
> **Dissolution**
> The act of dissolving a solute into a solvent to form a solution
> 
> Happens when the solvent creates bonds with with the solute.
>> [!example]
>> When water dissolves table salt ($\text{NaCl}$), 
>> 1. The negative side of the water molecules ($O$) bonds with the positively charged Sodium ($Na$)
>> 2. The positive side of water ($H$) bonds with the negatively charged Chlorine ($Cl$)
>
> Other non-ionic molecules can also be dissolved if water can create hydrogen bonds with the surface of the molecule (for example sugar)

> **Aqueous Solution**
> A solution where the solvent is water.
> 
> ***
> **Hydration Shell**
> A sphere of water molecules surrounding a molecule.

#### Strong solvent properties
Since Water is strongly partially charged with and can Hydrogen Bond, it can easily bond to other charged substances as well, dissolving them easily.

#### Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances

> [!def]
> **Hydrophilic**
> A substance attracted to water
>>[!example]
>> Since **Cotton** is hydrophilic, as it is made of large chains of cellulose, it can easily bond with water.
>> This allows cotton to easily absorb water, making it good towels. Since Cellulose is a large molecule, it does not get dissolved by water and can maintain its structure.

> **Hydrophobic**
> A substance repelled by water.
>> [!example]
>> Kitchen oil repels water because it is non-polar and doesn't have charges.

## Acidity
Occasionally, two molecules of water may accidentally exchange a hydrogen ion, making one Hydronium and one Hydroxide
Hydronium is commonly abbreviated from $H_3O^+$ to $H^+$

### pH
- pH is a logarithmic scale meaning that to get from pH 7 to 6, it is 10x more acidic.
- Since pH is defined as **$-\log{[H^+]}$**, the more $H^+$ there is the more acidic it will be

### Acidity Buffers
Most living cells operate at a pH close to 7 (neutral), and any deviation from this pH can cause large issues for for the cell.

> [!def]
> **Buffer**
> A substance that minimises changes in pH in a solution.

Buffers can absorb hydrogen ions when the pH is too low (acidic) and also release hydrogen ions when the pH is too high (basic).
