### Carbohydrates
There are three kinds of carbohydrates
- [[#Monosaccharides]]
- [[#Disaccharides]]
- [[#Polysaccharides]]

Carbs are sugars (mono and di) and polymers of sugars (poly)
They provide quick energy and also serve as structural support

#### Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides are normally charachterized by the amount of Carbons in the backbone and where the carbonyl group ($C=O$) is located
>[!def]
> **Monosaccharides**
> Literally means "**single sugar**"
> It is the **monomer** of disaccharides and polysacchrides

#### Disaccharides
> [!def]
> **Disaccharides**
> Are "**double sugars**", simply two monosaccharides glycosidically linked together.
> ***
> 
> **Glycosidic Linkage**
> A covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by dehydration.

Disaccharides are normally used as a **mean to transport energy** within an organism.

> [!example]
> `````col
> ````col-md
> **Maltose**
> ```molecule3d
> maltose
> ```
> ```molecule
> maltose
> ```
> Maltose is a disaccharide of two glucose molecules
> ````

> **Sucrose**
> ```molecule3d
> sucrose
> ```
> ```molecule
> sucrose
> ```
> Surcrose is a disaccharide of a glucose and fructose molecule
> ````
> `````

#### Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are normally characterized by two things
- $\alpha$ or $\beta$ bonding
- Amount of branching

> [!def]
> **Polysaccharides**
> Are long chains of monosaccharides linked with glycosydic bonds

Polysaccharides are normally used to **store energy** and serve as **building material** for organism (like cellulose in a cell wall)

> [!example] 
> **Starch**
> - Plants use starch to store energy (monomers are **$\alpha$ glucose**)
> - Starch tends to be not as branched
> ***
> 
> **Glycogen**
> - Humans store glycogen in muscles to provide energy when needed.
> - Is made from **$\alpha$ glucose**
> - It is extensively branched so that it can be easily broken down when necessary.
> ***
> 
> **Cellulose**
> - Plants use cellulose as a building material to provide structure in the cell wall (monomers are **$\beta$ glucose**)
> - Cellulose is never branched
> - Is hard to digest and most animals cannot break down cellulose to produce usable energy.
> ***
> 
> **Chitin**
> - Insects use Chitin as an exoskeleton due to its strong structure.
> - Uses **$\beta$ chitin** as its monomer, making it hard to digest as well
> ````col
> ```molecule
> N-[(2R)-2,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]acetamide
> ```
> The chitin monomer has a similar structure to cellulose except it contains a nitrogen attachment on the carbon backbone
> ```molecule
> cellulose
> ```
> ````

##### The difference between $\alpha$ Glucose and $\beta$ Glucose
$\alpha$ Glucose will always bond on the same side, while $\beta$ Glucose will bond in alternating patterns.
A similar thing is found for proteins, if bonded like an $\alpha$ then it will form $\alpha$ helices, while $\beta$ bonding will form $\beta pleats.


### Lipids
There are three kinds of Lipids
1. [[#Fats]]
2. [[#Phospholipids]]
3. [[#Steroids]]

> [!def]
> **Lipids**
> - Are a group of macromolecules defined by being hydrophobic
> - Are very diverse
> - Contains a lot of Hydrocarbons ($\text{C}-\text{H}$)
> ***
> 
> **Ester Linkages**
> A bond between a **Hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}$)** and a **Carboxyl group ($\text{COOH}$)**
> Formed by a dehydration reaction
> ***
> 
> **Carboxyl group ($\text{COOH}$)**
> - A group of atoms which is a combination of a **carbonyl group ($\text{C}-\text{O}$)** and a **hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}$)**
> - The bonding will look similar to **$\text{O}-\text{C}-\text{OH}$** where the central carbon will be bonded to something else, often a carbon backbone

#### Fats
Fats are used for:
- **Storing energy**: Organisms store large amounts of energy in the hydrocarbon chains of fats. Fats contain twice the amount of energy for the same weight as compared to Phospholipids.
- **Insulation**: Fats provide insulation from heat or cold as well as protection to vitals in the body.

There are two kinds of Fats
1. [[#Unsaturated Fats]]
2. [[#Saturated Fats]]

> [!def]
> **Fats**
> - A large molecule formed by a dehydration reaction between **Glycerol** and **Fatty Acids**
> - There will always be one glycerol and **three** fatty acids
> - Are sometimes called **Triglycerides** or **Triglycerols** because of the three fatty acids
> - Are Completely nonpolar and hydrophobic
> ***
> 
> **Fatty Acids**
> A carbon skeleton usually **16-18** carbons long ending with a carboxyl group
> These are often referred to as the "tails" of the Fat
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> palmitic acid
> ```
> **Palimitic Acid**
> A common fatty acid that is bonded with glycerol to form a fat.
> Notice the Carboxyl (COOH) on the end
> ````
> ***
> **Glycerol ($C_3H_8O_3$)**
> An alcohol that holds together all the fatty acids to form fats.
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> glycerol
> ```
> **Glycerol**
> Contains three Hydroxyl groups (OH) to ester link with the fatty acids
> ````
> ***
> 
> **Unsaturated Fats**
> - Fats that contain unsaturated fatty acids, which contain double bonds.
> - Often **Liquid** at room temperature due to not being able to pack closely together.
> ***
> 
> **Saturated Fats**
> - Fats of which all their Fatty Acids are saturated and do not contain double bonds and are perfectly straight.
> - Often **Solid** at room temperature due to being space efficient.

##### Unsaturated Fats
Unsaturated Fats' Fatty Acids often contain "kinks" in them from **cis-double bonding** in the carbon skeleton, disallowing them to pack closely, leading them to be liquid at room temperature.

Unsaturated Fats may also contain **trans-double bonding**, classifying these fats as **trans fats**.

> [!def]
> **Cis-double bonding**
> - Happens when two **Carbons are double bonded** and the remaining bonds to these Carbons are on the **same side** of the molecule.
> - Since the other molecules are on the same side of the molecule, it **forces the molecule to bend** in the other direction
> ***
> 
> **Trans-double bonding**
> - Happens when two Carbons are double bonded and the remaining bonds are on **opposite sides** of the molecule.
> - Since the extra bonds are on opposite sides, they balance out and this double bond **does not cause bending** of the molecule.
> ***
> 
> **Trans Fats**
> Saturated Fats of which their Fatty Acids contain trans-double bonding, which may allow them to be straight and unbent.
> Trans Fats have also been linked to coronary heart disease due to blockage of blood vessels

##### Saturated Fats
Saturated Fats' Fatty Acids are completely straight and are called **Hydrogen saturated**, because each carbon in the skeleton is bonded to two Hydrogens as well as two Carbons, disallowing any double bonding from happening in the skeleton (which cause kinks).

Saturated fats have also been linked to negative health side effects, especially with causing issues of blood flow.

> [!def]
> **Hydrogen saturated fatty acid**
> Where every Carbon on a fatty acid's Carbon skeleton is bonded to two Hydrogens, as well as the two neighbouring carbons.
> This allows the fatty acid to be straight as there is no double bonding.

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Tristearin
> ```
> ```col-md
> **<- Tristearin**
> A saturated fat made of three **Stearic acid** fatty acids.
> 
> **Stearic acid ->**
> A saturated fatty acid with a 18C backbone
> ```
> ```molecule3d
> Stearic acid
> ```
> ````

#### Phospholipids
Are used for:
1. Making up the cell membrane

Phospholipids are similar to Fats as they are also made of **glycerol and three connecting molecules**, connected by **Ester Linkages**
When Phospholipids are put in water, they will self assemble into a **bilayer** because of the uneven polarity of the molecules.

Composed of:
1. Glycerol
2. Two Hydrophobic fatty acids tails
3. Phosphate group
4. Occasionally a hydrophilic molecule

> [!example]
> **Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine**
> An example phospholipid that has two bent tails and a hydrophobic head
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine
> ```
> ```col-md
> ![[Pasted image 20220822225335.png]]
> ```
> ````

> [!def]
> **Phospholipid Bilayer**
> A membrane made of **two layers of phospholipids** where the hydrophobic heads are pointing to the surface of the layer and the hydrophobic tails are facing each other on the interior of the layer.
> Looks something like o=|=o where the **o** are the heads and the **=** are the tails.
> ![[Pasted image 20220822225306.png]]

#### Steroids
Lipids that are characterised by their **four fused rings**: three six atom rings then a five atom ring. On the last ring (ring D).
**One fatty acid** is often attached and is called the **functional group** of the steroid

> [!def]
> **Fused Rings**
> Rings of atoms that share a side.
>> [!example]
>> ````col
>> ```molecule3d
>> Decahydronaphthalene
>> ```
>> **Decahydronaphthalene**
>> A molecule consisting of two fused cyclohexane rings
>> ````
>> ````col
>> **Cyclohexane**
>> A molecule consisting of only a ring of 6 carbons and attaching hydrogen
>> ```molecule3d
>> Cyclohexane
>> ```
>> ````

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Gonane
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Gonane**
> The simplest steroid consisting of only three rings of cyclohexane followed by one ring of cyclopentane.
> Gonane has no attached fatty acid or functional group

> ````col
> ```molecule3d

### Proteins
Are used for:
1. Being Enzymes
2. Storage
3. Defence
4. Transport
5. Hormones
6. Receptors
7. Motor / Movement
8. Structure

> [!def]
> **Protein**
> Proteins are the primary macromolecule and consist for more than half of the dry mass of an organism
> Proteins are made of one or more Polypeptides
> ***
> 
> **Polypeptides**
> Polymers (chains) of Amino Acids
> literally means many peptides
> ***
> 
> **Amino Acids**
> The Monomers of Proteins and Polypeptides.
> ***
> 
> **Peptide Bonding**
> - A bond between each Amino Acid formed through dehydration synthesis
> - Bonds the Nitrogen in the **Amino group** to the Carbon in the **Carboxyl group**

#### Amino Acids
Can be categorised as:
1. Nonpolar (hydrophobic)
2. Polar (hydrophilic)
3. Electrically Charged (hydrophilic)
	1. Acidic (Negative)
	2. Basic (Positive)

Consists of:
1. Amino Group ($-\text{NH}_2$)
2. Carboxyl Group ($-\text{COOH}$)
3. $\alpha$ Carbon ($\text{C}$)
4. Hydrogen ($\text{H}$)
5. **R group**, also called the **side chain**

The $\alpha$ Carbon is bonded to all the amino group, carboxyl group, R chain, and one hydrogen.
The R chain is what differentiates the different Amino acids, as the rest of the molecule is exactly the same.

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Glycine
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Glycine**
> The most basic Amino Acid, with its side chain consisting of only a single Hydrogen atom.
> Notice the amino group ($-\text{NH}_2$), carboxyl group ($-\text{COOH}$), and $\alpha$ carbon.
> ```
> ```molecule
> Glycine
> ```
> ````

##### Polar Amino Acids
Can be recognised by having a side chain that ends with a **hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$)**, **Amino group ($-\text{NH}_2$)**, or **Sulfhydryl group ($-\text{SH}$)**

Cysteine is only classified as Polar because the sulfyhydryl group is only weakly polar

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Cysteine
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Cysteine**
> A (weakly) Polar Amino acid with the chain ending in a sulfhydryl group
> ```
> ```molecule
> Cysteine
> ```
> ````

##### Nonpolar Amino Acids
Can be recognised by having a non-charged nonpolar tip of the side chain

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Phenylalanine
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Phenylalanine**
> A nonpolar amino acid
> ```
> ```molecule
> Phenylalanine
> ```
> ````

##### Electrically Charged Amino Acids
###### Acidic (Negative)
Can be recognised by having a negatively charged tip of the side chain by lacking additional Hydrogen bonds.

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Aspartic acid
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Aspartic acid**
> A negatively charged amino acid
> Notice how the tip has a negatively charged Oxygen due to missing an additional Hydrogen
> ```
> ```molecule
> Aspartic acid
> ```
> ````

###### Basic (Positive)
Can be recognised by having a positively charged tip of the side chain by having additional Hydrogen bonds.ttps://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=sparknotes&ia=web

> [!example]
> ````col
> ```molecule3d
> Histidine
> ```
> ```col-md
> **Histidine**
> A positively charged amino acid
> Notice how the tip has a Nitrogen with additional bonds to Hydrogen, making it a positively charged molecule.
> ```
> ```molecule
> Histidine
> ```
> ````

#### Polypeptides
Are chains of amino acids, bonded through **Peptide Bonding** from the **N-terminus** to the **C-terminus**

> [!def]
> **N-terminus**
> The side of a polypeptide chain (or amino acid) that ends in the **Amino group ($-\text{NH}_2$)**
> ***
> 
> **C-terminus**
> The side of a polypeptide chain (or amino acid) that ends in the **Carboxyl group ($-\text{COOH}$**)

#### Structures in a Protein
##### Primary Structure
- Primary Structures are defined as a linear string of amino acids, which make up polypeptide chains.
- Bonded by Peptide Bonding

##### Secondary Structure
- Parts of the polypeptide chain that "folds" into either **$\alpha$ helices** or **$\beta$ pleated sheets**
- These structures are formed by the hydrogen bonding from one part of the chain to another. This happens because some parts of the chain is positive, negative, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic.

###### $\alpha$ Helices
Helices are spirals on the polypeptide chain formed by Hydrogen bonds formed with itself every four amino acids or so 
![[Pasted image 20220824100341.png]]

###### $\beta$ pleated sheets
Pleated sheets are formed when multiple **$\beta$ strands** are bonded next to each other, forming a wide pleated sheet.
These $\beta$ strands are on different parts of the polypeptide chain, but still bond to each other due to charges.

![[Pasted image 20220824100739.png]]

> [!def]
> **$\beta$ strands**
> An individual string of the polypeptide chain that is part of a $\beta$ sheet.
> Multiple strands are hydrogen bonded parallel to each other to form a singular sheet.


##### Tertiary Structure
- Tertiary Structures are the overall shape of a polypeptide
- These structures can happen for four reasons
	1. Hydrophobic Interactions
	2. Hydrogen bonding
	3. Ionic Bonding (from electrically charged amino acids)
	4. DIsulfide Bridges

> [!def]
> **DIsulfide Bridge**
> An attraction between two sulphur atoms part of a sulfyhydryl groups ($-\text{SH}$)
> This kind of bonding only happens to the amino acid Cysteine

##### Quaternary Structure
- Some proteins are made of multiple polypeptide chains, so quaternary structures are simply the shape that forms as a result of these polypeptide chains interacting with each other.

### Nucleic Acids
There are two kinds of Nucleic Acids
1. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
2. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)

Nucleic Acids are made up of **nucleotides** (the monomer), this makes Nucleic Acids polynucleotides, with bonds to each other called **phosphodiester linkages**

#### DNA
- DNA stores all the information for life
- This is what is inherited from parents
- DNA is just the instructions for what to do, it doesn't actually do it
- Forms a double helix and is anti-parallel

> [!def]
> **Anti-parallel**
> Two strands of DNA running beside each other but facing different directions
> Imagine two pencils next to each other but one points up and one points down

#### RNA
- RNA is an intermediary step to produce proteins from DNA
- The process to create proteins looks something similar to:
	- **DNA -> RNA -> Proteins**
- There are three kinds of RNA
	- mRNA (messenger RNA)
	- rRNA (ribosomal RNA)
	- tRNA (transfer RNA)

![[Pasted image 20220824205024.png]]

##### mRNA
- mRNA's function is to **hold a copy of DNA** and take it out of the nucleus to be used

##### rRNA
- rRNA **forms the proteins** inscribed on the mRNA
- It reads the mRNA and connects the correct Amino Acids together to form proteins

##### tRNA
- tRNA **brings the correct Amino Acids** associated with the genetic sequence to the rRNA
- each tRNA matches its specific three nucleotide code to a specific amino acid

#### Nucleotides
Are made up of three parts:
1. Five carbon sugar (pentose)
2. Nitrogenous base (The part that can change)
3. One to three phosphate groups (one when its polymerised and three before)

![[Pasted image 20220824211535.png]]

##### Nucleosides
> [!def]
> **Nucleoside**
> The combination of the pentose and nitrogenous base in a nucleotide
> This excludes the phosphate group

##### Pentose
The pentose holds the Nitrogenous base to the Phosphate group
The pentose of a nucleotide can either be
1. Deoxyribose (for DNA)
2. Ribose (for RNA)

> [!example]
> `````col
> ````col-md
> **Deoxyribose**
> ```molecule
> beta-D-2-Deoxyribose
> ```
> Notice how the structure is missing a singular Oxygen atom
> This is why it is called de-oxy-ribose (Ribose missing Oxygen)
> ````
> ````col-md
> **Ribose**
> ```molecule
> D-ribofuranose
> ```
> \* It may appear that there are extra Hydrogens in this image, but the Hydrogens are just being abbreviated in the other image, they are still there
> ````
> `````

##### Nitrogenous Base
- The Nitrogenous base is the part of each Nucleotide that can differ
- The sequence of Nitrogenous bases are what actually store the information in the DNA and RNA.

There are two kinds of Nitrogenous Bases:
1. Pyrimidines
2. Purines

Curiously, when two nitrogenous bases are paired, the amount of oxygen will add up to two atoms.

###### Pyrimidines
- Pyrimidines are constructed out of a single six-sided ring
- Smaller than Purines

Includes 
1. Cytosine (C), pairs with Guanine by **three** Hydrogen Bonds
2. Thymine (T, for DNA), pairs with Adenine by **two** Hydrogen Bonds
3. Uracil (U, for RNA), pairs with Adenine by **two** Hydrogen Bonds

> [!example]
> `````col
> ````col-md
> **Cytosine**
> ```molecule3d
> Cytosine
> ```
> Contains **one** Oxygen Atom
> ````
> ````col-md
> **Thymine**
> ```molecule3d
> Thymine
> ```
> Contains **two** Oxygen Atoms
> ````
> ````col-md
> **Uracil**
> ```molecule3d
> Uracil
> ```
> Contains **two** Oxygen Atoms
> ````
> `````

###### Purines
- Purines are constructed out of a side sided ring fused to a five sided ring
- Larger than Pyrimidines

Includes 
1. Adenine (A), pairs with Thymine and Uracil by **two** Hydrogen Bonds
2. Guanine (G), pairs with Cytosine by **three** Hydrogen Bonds

> `````col
> ````col-md
