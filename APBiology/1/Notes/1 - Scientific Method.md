# Scientific Method
1. Observe an event
2. Research
3. Ask a question
4. Create a Hypothesis to answer the question
5. Design and plan an experiment to test the Hypothesis
6. Execute the experiment
7. Analyse your results
8. Conclude and ask a new question

## Example experiment
### Previous Knowledge
- 5 ppm of Nitrate is better than no Nitrate

### Question
- **What is the optimal Nitrate concentration?**

### Hypothesis
- **More Nitrate => Better Plant Growth**

### Experiment
#### Constants
- Seed
	- Size
	- Type
	- Age
- Water
	- Amount
	- Temperature
- Soil
	- Amount
	- Type

#### Experimental Groups
- Controls:
	- Negative: No Nitrate
	- Positive: 5 ppm of Nitrate
- Experimental
	- 2.5 ppm (Less Nitrate)
	- 10 ppm (More Nitrate)
	- 100 ppm (A lot more Nitrate)
