# Properties of Water

water
```
**Water** ($H_2O$) Forms a V shaped molecule with the $H$ ends having a partial positive charge and the $O$ ends having a partial negative charge.
````

> [!def]
> **Hydrogen Bonding**
> A relatively strong intermolecular force.
> The positive charge of the $H$ is attracted to the negative charges of other molecules. In the case of water, the negative charge is on the $O$ side.
> 
> In liquid water, a hydrogen bond is about **1/20th** as strong as a covalent bond

## The four emergent properties of water
### Cohesion

> [!def]
> **Cohesion**
> The bonds that hold a substance together. 
> 
> In water, Hydrogen bonds act as the cohesion force.
> ***
> **Surface Tension**
> The difficulty of stretching or puncturing the surface of a liquid
> 
> Since water's cohesion force is Hydrogen Bonding (a relatively strong intermolecular force), its surface tension is also high. Additionally, the Hydrogen bonds do *not* bond with the surrounding air, increasing its surface tension
> ***
> **Adhesion**
> The bonds that hold a substance to something else.
> 
> Water also has a relatively strong adhesive force to certain materials because of its polarity and Hydrogen bonding.

#### Cohesion and Surface Tension help support Life
- High surface tension allows things to float easily
- Adhesion allows plants to transport water up its roots and stem against the gravity

### Moderation of Temperature

> [!def]
> **Thermal Energy**
> The *total* amount of kinetic energy a certain amount of particles have.
> The faster the particles move, the more kinetic energy it has, meaning more thermal energy, meaning higher **Temperature**
> ***
> **Temperature**
> The *average* amount of kinetic energy in a substance.
> ***
> **Specific Heat**
> The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1g of a substance by 1 degree C.
> 
> The higher the specific heat, the more resistant to temperature change the substance is.
> ***
> **Heat**
> Amount of thermal energy being *transferred* from one body of matter to another.
> ***
> **Calorie**
> Defined as the Specific heat of Liquid Water.
> ***
> **Heat of Vaporization**
> The amount of energy needed to convert a liquid into gas.

> $\text{\small{Temperature vs Absorbed Heat for Water}}$
> 
> Un-intuitively, the temperature of the substance will actually stop increasing while undergoing a phase change until enough energy is absorbed to finish the phase change.

#### Water's High Specific Heat
Water has a very high Specific Heat in comparison to most other materials. This means that it can absorb a lot of energy before increasing its Temperature. 

For comparison, Water's specific heat is **10x** that of Iron.

#### Water's High Heat of Vaporisation
Water also has a high heat of vaporisation. This allows water to absorb a lot of energy once it is at boiling point before actually changing into a gas.

> [!def]
> **Evaporative Cooling**
> When hotter molecules are more likely to evaporate, leaving the average temperature of the remaining liquid cooler.

#### Water's Moderation of Temperature helps support Life
- Allows water to absorb a lot of energy without gaining a lot of temperature, such as the oceans absorbing a lot of energy from the Sun without heating up throughout the day.
- Allows organisms too cool themselves down with the help of a high heat of vaporisation as well as evaporative cooling.

### Floating of Ice on Water
Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than a liquid. This allows Ice to float on Water. 
![[IceLattice.png]]
When water is locked into this kind of lattice, it has more empty space than when it is a liquid, making it less dense.

#### Floating Ice's importance to Life
- Floating Ice protects ponds and other bodies of water from completely freezing over. Since ice floats, the water remains underneath the ice.

### The Solvent of Life 

> [!def]
> **Dissolution**
> The act of dissolving a solute into a solvent to form a solution
> 
> Happens when the solvent creates bonds with with the solute.
>> [!example]
>> When water dissolves table salt ($\text{NaCl}$), 
>> 1. The negative side of the water molecules ($O$) bonds with the positively charged Sodium ($Na$)
>> 2. The positive side of water ($H$) bonds with the negatively charged Chlorine ($Cl$)
>
> Other non-ionic molecules can also be dissolved if water can create hydrogen bonds with the surface of the molecule (for example sugar)
> 
> ***
> **Aqueous Solution**
> A solution where the solvent is water.
