water
```
**Water** ($H_2O$) Forms a V shaped molecule with the $H$ ends having a partial positive charge and the $O$ ends having a partial negative charge.
````

> [!def]
> **Hydrogen Bonding**
> The positive charge of the $H$ is attracted to the negative charges of other molecules. In the case of water, the negative charge is on the $O$ side.
> 
> In liquid water, a hydrogen bond is about **1/20th** as strong as a covalent bond

## The four emergent properties of water
### Cohesion

> [!def]
> **Cohesion**
> The bonds that hold a substance together. 
> 
> In water, Hydrogen bonds act as the cohesion force

### Moderation of Temperature

### Floating of Ice on Water

### The Solvent of Life
