**Quick-check**: On a normal distribution curve, what percentage of data points will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean? Why does the graph show 34.1%?
- 68.2%, because 34.1% is only one side of the bell curve

(/\\ Number of Drops (2SD, 95% confidence))

### Conclusion
This shows that adding soap to distilled water does ruin the hydrogen bonding because the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, meaning we can be 95% confident that soap does decrease the effectivity of water to water bonding (hydrogen bonding)
