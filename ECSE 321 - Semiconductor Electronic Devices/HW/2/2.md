## 3.3

An unknown semiconductor has $E_{g} = 1.1~ eV$ and $N_{c} = N_{v}$. It is doped with $10^{15}~ cm^{-3}$ donors, where the donor level is $0.2~ eV$ below $E_{c}$. Given that $E_{F}$ is $0.25~ eV$ below $E_{c}$, calculate $n_{i}$ and the concentration of electrons and holes in the semiconductor at $300~ K$.

## 3.8

Calculate the band gap of `Si` from Eq. (3–23) and plot $n_{i}$ vs. $1000/T$ (Fig. 3–17).

Hint: The slope cannot be measured directly from a semilogarithmic plot; read the values from two points on the plot and take the natural logarithm as needed for the solution.

## 3.11

A new semiconductor has $N_{c} = 10^{19}~ cm^{-3}$, $N_{v} = 5 \times 10^{18}~ cm^{-3}$, and $E_{g} = 2~ eV$. If it is doped with $10^{17}$ donors (fully ionized), calculate the electron, hole, and intrinsic carrier concentrations at $627~\degree C$. Sketch the simplified band diagram, showing the position of $E_{F}$.
