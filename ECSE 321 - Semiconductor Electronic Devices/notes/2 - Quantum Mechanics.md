# Quantum Mechanics

**Quantum Mechanics**: a method to explain the behavior of small particles (electron size)

Normally takes one of two approaches: Heisenburg's or Schrodiner's

## Photoelectric Effect

When the surface of metal is exposed to light in a vacuum, electrons and ejected.

## Schrodinger's Approach

Schrodinger conceptualized quantum mechanics as wave mechanics.

1. There exists uncertainty
2. Uncertainties must be accounted for with probabilities
