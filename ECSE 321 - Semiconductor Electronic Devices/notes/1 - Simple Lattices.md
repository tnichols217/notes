# Simple Lattices

## Semiconductors

**Semiconductor**: A group of materials having electrical conductivities between metals and insulators

Can be varied through:
- Temperature
- Optical excitation
- Impurity incorporation (doping)

Generally are in columns $III$ $IV$ $V$ on the periodic table

## Crystal Lattices

**Lattice**: a periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystalline material
**Unit Cell**: The repeated volume of the lattice

Can be of general forms:
- Amorphous — no order
- Polycrystalline — local order
- Single Crystalline — global order

|          | Amorphous | Polycrystalline | Single Crystalline |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Mobility | Low       | Med             | High               |
|          |           |                 |                    |

### Cubic Lattice

The simplest unit cell, each edge length is the same, and all angles are right.

Types:
- Simple cube — an atom at the 8 corners of a cube
- Body-centered cubic — an atom at the 8 corners of a cube and one at the center of the cube
- Face-centered cubic — an atom at the 8 corners of a cube and 6 on each center of each face on the cube

#### Planes and Directions

**Directions** in a cubic lattice are represented as a bracketed scaled coordinate.

Directions must be scaled such that the largest component of the vector is scaled to be $1$.

For example: $[001]$ represents the upward $\hat z$ vector.

**Planes** are represented by their normal vector.

### Diamond Lattice

Also known as zincblnde, the diamond lattice is a FCC lattice with an extra atom positioned at $0.25a+0.25b+0.25c$ offset from each FCC atom.

This looks like two FCC lattices interlocked with each other with that specified offset.

A silicon lattice is an example of a diamond lattice.

The diamond lattice has a common binary compound formation: the $III-V$ diamond lattice. Ternary and quaternary compounds also exist.

#### III-V Diamond Lattice

For diamond lattices formed form $III$ and $V$ materials, one of the FCC's will be made of $III$ and the other will be made of $V$.

There is no competition between the $III$ and $V$ elements.
