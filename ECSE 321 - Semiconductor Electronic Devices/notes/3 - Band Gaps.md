# Band Gaps

- Conduction bands tend to have complicated minimum total energies, having multiple local minima across different momentums

## Direct Bandgap

- The minimum gap between conduction bands are at the same momentum $k$
- Only a change in energy, not momentum is required to jump the bandgap

## Indirect Bandgap

- momentum $k$ is not the same, so often more energy is required to jump the gap
