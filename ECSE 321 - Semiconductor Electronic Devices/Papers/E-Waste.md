- 95% of li-ions are not recycled (2632)
- Making recycling closed loop will make recycling more prevalent and available, while reducing the amount of toxic waste (2632)
- lead is toxic, and thus regulated on how it can be recycled (2634)
- Not many places mandate that li-ion batterys be recycled, and even when it is, it is not often enforced (2634)
- Not much economic benefit to recycling, and thus it is not done (2634)
- Recycling was 9% before regulation in the EU (2634)
- Graph is good!!! (2634)

### Li-ion battery recycling challenges

(Ma)

- Many countries have electrification goals, and many car manufacturers have similar goals (2843)
- Li-ion batterys typically last 1-3 years for consumer electronics, and 8-10 years for EVs (2843)
- They create significant environmental concerns due to their high content of heavy metals (2843)
- About 1 million tons of spent Li-ions were made in 2023
- Li-ion batteries come in various shapes and compositions, making them hard to recycle (2844-2845)
	- Shapes: cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch
	- Some are bonded with epoxy
- Battery design is focused more on density than it is on its ability to be recycled (2845)
- Recycling old cathode designs into new cathode designs is a concern to have (2845)
- Anodes are extremely hard to recycle as graphite gets blocked and silicon will crack (2845)
- Modern Solid State batteries, while pushed for by the EV community, are hard to impossible to recycle (2846)
- Hard to remain economically viable as rare-earth materials are trying to be reduced in batteries (2846)
- Hard to convince battery manufacturers to accecpt recycled materials due to their decrease in quality (2847)

### Challenges in Ecofriendly Battery Recycling

(Doose)

- Most battery recycling processes involve a mixture of multiple processes including pyro and hydrometallurgical processing. (2)
- Often slag has to be processed hydrometallurgically (2)
- Next generation batteries will have more diverse materials, requiring more research in how to recycle them (5)
- Current recycling methods undergo a long and complicated process. (3)
	- discharge
	- disassembly
	- crushing
	- drying
	- mixing
	- classification
- Modern batteries have extremely high battery densities and make handing them unsafe and difficult (8)
	- Direct electrical shock
	- Thermal runaway hazards
	- Chemical hazards
- Using an inert atmosphere is sometimes a solution to difficult batteries, which make processing them more difficult (9)
- Developing circular recycling techniques is important for reducing CO2 output (9)
- Mechanical treatments use much less energy than metallurgical processes (10)
	- Pyro (4.68 MJ) per kg
	- Hydro (0.125 MJ, 3.76L waste water) per kg
- Batteries need to be more intentionally designed to be recyclable, instead of eco friendliness being an afterthought (11)
- We need to reduce the number of steps in the recycling process, because in order to achieve a 95% effeciency overall, thats roughly 99% for 5 steps (11)
- Different materials have differen toxicities, from polymers being difficult to process to some chemicals emmitting toxic fumes (12)
- Some batteries are so cheap that they will never make a profit being recycled (13)

### Key issues for Li-io battery recycling

	- Dust contamination
	- Contaminated waste
	- SO2 emissions
	- Chlorinated emissions
- Overall, the contaminations in recycling are worth it for the amount of environmental impact it has (379)

### The importance of design in lithium ion battery recycling

(Thompson)

- The usage of adhesives and hermetic seals makes disassembly and thus recycling difficult (7589)
- Variation of pack configurations make it difficult to consistently recycle and open battery packs (7591)
- Most batteries are not labeled with their internals, making recycling difficult (7597)
- Storage and transportation are a major concern with the recycling of batteries (7598)
- We need more legislation to make batteries designed in a way to be recyclable (7598)

## Paper

In our current drive for electrification and reduction of emissions from oil, governments and companies around the world are pushing for newer and better battery technologies. Personal devices like phones, laptops, and PCs as well as grid stabilizing batteries and EVs are major sinks of battery technology. This huge demand for a shift towards electrification led to a huge increase in battery production worldwide, at a speed where recycling and closed-loop solutions could not keep up. In order to preserve the environment better and remain more eco-friendly, battery design needs to be more recycling conscious and stronger legislation needs to be put into place in order to achieve a more eco-friendly and sustainable future.

Currently in the EU, around 95% of Lithium-Ion batteries are unrecycled, leading to a huge waste and pollution in our environment (Heelan, 2632). Yet, many leading countries around the world maintain a want for further recycling and reuse of batteries (Ma, 2843). This want to preserve our environment through better recycling however is not easy, as typically the recycling processes for batteries are incredibly complex, energy and time-consuming, produce waste products of their own, and are economically unfavorable. Even with government initiative around the world, more recently roughly only 9% of all batteries have been recycled, where many small batteries are never even considered for recycling (Heelan, 2634). Recycling such a small amount of the available batteries is a problem in all of legislation, economy, and capability.

Many current day recycling techniques focus on the recycling of larger batteries, and only of specific portions of the battery. Modern EU goals want about 95% of the battery to be recycled by at least 2025, which is an incredibly difficult task given where we are today (Doose, 11). Today's methods for recycling battery materials mainly fall into one or more of three categories: mechanical, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical (Heelan, 2635, Doose, 10). Each of these techniques come with their own unique benefits and drawbacks. Mechanical recycling involves the shredding, disassembly, and recovery of battery terminals, while maintaining the lowest energy cost, but highest human intervention. Pyrometallurgical recycling processes involve melting and sorting the slag of the battery with temperatures as high as 1000C, at the cost of the most energy cost. Lastly, hydrometallurgical recycling processes involve chemical dissolution and processing of raw materials or slag to separate or refine output products of the recycling process.

Another major way of recycling is to repurpose batteries in their "second life". This method of recycling is looking exponentially grow in our current years, roughly from an evaluation of 16 millions dollars in 2016 to 3 billion dollars in 2036 (Heelan, 2635). Battery repurposement mainly happens when larger batteries from EVs are useds as grid stabilizers, saving energy companies stress on the grid by acting as large buffers of energy when demand or supply are not particularly stable. When used in EVs or consumer devices, often a battery capacity of 80% or lower is seen as unacceptable and in need of replacement, creating this massive market of good-enough batteries for other less specific purposes. Batteries may also be repurposed in other areas where energy density or volume are not as particularly important, such as home or commercial on-site backups. This method of recycling is the least energy intensive, most eco-friendly and easiest method of battery recycling, but at the cost that these batteries do not get remade into more modern chemistries and are not purpose made for their application, reducing their usefulness.

Traditional recycling of these batteries for their raw materials is a long, expensive, and toxic process. Any form of recycling typically comes at some great cost that makes it economically unviable for private companies to do, making it significantly less prevalent than necessary for our usage of the technology to be remotely eco-friendly. Many if not all current-day batteries contain toxic and reactive materials that are difficult to process. A typical recycling process contains many steps involving discharging, disassembling, and multiple steps of crshing, drying, and separating. These steps all encounter hazards of high voltage electric shock, thermal runaway fires, chemical leakages, lead poisoning, and multiple fine powder toxins that may be disperse in the air (Doose, 3, 8, 12). These steps typically involve a mixture of mechanical, pyro, and hydrometallurgical techniques of refining. The current steps of refinement are extremely energy intensive often not economicaly favorable as pyrometallurgical refinement normally takes around 4.68 MJ of energy per kilogram, with hydrometallurgical refinement taking 0.125 MJ while producing 3.76 L of toxic waste water per kilogram of material refined (Doose, 10). This wastewaster and creation of other toxic materials are a large reason why recycling batteries is a difficult task, as neutralization and treatment of such byproducts are still in research (Baum, 715). While this process requires less energy than mining and refining raw ore, it takes longer and produces lower grade raw materials than mining itself, making it unappealing to battery manufacturers (Baum, 715, Ma 2847). 

Other issues with modern battery recycling involve safe removal, transportation, and reuse of batteries. Batteries such as those in EVs — being high power — require both specialized technicians and equipment to remove, while removal in some consumer electronics prove to be difficult or economically wasteful (Galmes, 9, Thompson, 7598). Both Lead acid batteries and lithium batteries are difficult to transport due to their toxicities and tendency to spontaneously combust and create thermal runaway events, increasing the cost of recycling batteries (Galmes, 10). In addition, batteries are designed to prevent such situations from happening, but this increase in safety also proves to be a detriment to recyclability in the long run. Adhesives and sealants used in creating batteries prove to increase the cost and difficultly of both reusing and recycling such batteries (Thumpson, 7589). Other various sources of difficulty come from a lack of regulation in labelling or recyclability of batteries. Separation of battery packs by their composition is an important step in improving the amount of recyclable materials in a battery, yet close to no batteries are marked with their composition on the packaging until they are intrusively opened (Thompson, 7597, Baum, 716). This great adversity to the recycling of batteries makes it extremely hard for the process to happen naturally without the push of government legislation or economic push.

Many recycling companies are pushing for less intrusive reuse of batteries to reduce the economic cost of recycling batteries as well as the push for less rare-earth materials in the production of batteries. This includes a full reuse of cathodes with minor treatment to the material. This comes at the cost that even the reused terminals of batteries will be at a lower quality and thus energy density from the industry standard for applications. The major push from multiple sources agrees that harsher legislation is required in order for battery recycling to become a feasible pathway of manufacturing (Thompson, 7598, Heelan, 2037) as well as the push for more intentionally recyclable batteries, involving easier disassembly and less rare-earth materials (Baum, 715, Doose, 11, Heelan, 2036). Even then, current government regulation proves to be ineffective without enforcement (Heelan, 2634). While the future of battery recycling appears difficult, it appears the main way to combat this is through stricter government regulation as our current methods of recycling are too far from economically viable and eco-friendliness to naturally permeate the market.

In our seeking to create a cleaner world by electrifying, we inadvertantly created our own problem of toxic battery waste. These batteries proove to be both toxic and difficult to recycle, either through second use, raw material recycling, or partial recycling. These recycling techniques typically also use large amounts of energy in order to produce a product that is more expensive, less pure, and takes more time to produce, leading battery manufacturers to not choose such options. Limited success has been seen in less energy dense critical fields, but is yet to prove effective in consumer electronics or EVs, both major sinks of our battery resources. Current solutions majorly bank on harsher legislation, better construction, and reduction of toxic materials in the construction of today's batteries.
