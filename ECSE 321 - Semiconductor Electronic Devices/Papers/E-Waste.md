## Prompt

You are to write a 3.5 to 4 page paper that discusses an issue or a set of issues related to the handling of electronic waste.  The paper should include discussions of the status quo, future projections and leading solutions.  The format of this paper is as follows:

1. 1 inch margins all around
2. Single spacing
3. 12 point font
4. Single column

The paper may include figures, graphs and charts.  If these are not original images, a reference should be included in a figure caption.  The wrap around function in MS Word (or equivalent) should be used to embed images into the text.

The paper should include references but the sources are not limited to peer reviewed journals. 

The paper should be your original work.  You may use AI programs to gather information, but not used to write the paper or even a draft of the paper.

## Notes

### Current and Prospective Li-Ion Battery Recycling and Recovery Processes

- Li-ion production is growing exponentially (2632)
- 95% of li-ions are not recycled (2632)
- Making recycling closed loop will make recycling more prevalent and available, while reducing the amount of toxic waste (2632)
- lead is toxic, and thus regulated on how it can be recycled (2634)
- Not many places mandate that li-ion batterys be recycled, and even when it is, it is not often enforced (2634)
- Not much economic benefit to recycling, and thus it is not done (2634)
