# Organization

## Relationships between two Spaces

### Space within a Space

- Large space enveloping a smaller space
- Difference in orientation or shape creates interest

### Interlocking Spaces

- Overlapping of two spaces
- Can create
	- Shared zone
	- Zone used by one space
	- A new zone that links the spaces

### Adjacent Spaces

- Two spaces next to each other often with a gap
- Separating plane often lmits visual and physical access
- Can be a freestanding plane within a space
	- Be defined by columns
	- Be defined by a change in elevation

### Spaces linked by a Common Space

- Two spaces linked by a shared third space
- Often the third space differs in form, orientation, or shape
- Can be linear to link distant spaces
- Larger third space => Can be the dominant space

## Spatial Organization

Organization normally fills requirements like
- Function
- Flexibility
- Uniqueness
- Grouped
- Ventilation/light
- Segregated
- Accessible
- Proximity

### Centralized Organization

Stable concentrated organization focused on a point or large dominant space
- Dominant space is often regular
- Often secondary spaces maintain the regularity of the dominant space
	- May differ based on requirements
	- At least one must serve as the entry
	- 

### Linear Organization

### Radial Organization

### Clustered Organization

### Grid Organization
