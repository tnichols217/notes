# Form

Form is the external appearance or structure of a work. It refers to the internal solid or just the surface of an object. It is primarily defined by shape, size, color, and texture.

## Visual Properties

### Shape

The outline or silhouette of a form. Gives a rough understanding of its 3D shape.

- Primary means of recognition of a form
- Depends on visual contrast to the background
- To architecture shape matters for
	- Enclosing planes: floors, walls
	- Opening: doors, windows
	- Silhouettes of buildings

### Size

The height, width, and depth of the form in comparison to the other objects around it.

### Color

The hue, saturation, or just value of the form being depicted. In architectural drawings, they tend to just be a range of values to show 3D contour and shadows.

### Texture

The visual and tactile property of a form given by the size, shape, arrangement, and proportion of the parts as well as the weight, sparsity, and type of stroke used to depict the form.

## Relational Properties

### Position

The location of a form relative to other forms. Gives an idea of space or compactness depending on its relation to other pieces.

### Orientation

The viewpoint of which the form is seen from. It effects what details are highlighted in the form.

### Visual Inertia

The degree or lack of stability in a form. It created a perceived motion or resolution of position. It depends on rotation, position, and relation to gravity or other forces.

## Primary Objects
### Shapes

#### Circle

- Centralized structure
- Self centering
- Can induce rotary motion when things are placed across its edge

#### Triangle

- Signifies Stability
- Can be balanced in a precarious state

#### Square

- Represents rationality and pureness
- Rectangles are derivations of squares
- When flat or perfectly diagonal, it exists in a balanced state
- Otherwise, it is in a precarious state

#### Other regular shapes

- The pentagon and hexagon can be derivations of a circle, with certain equilibrium points

### Curved surfaces

- Expresses fluidity
- Symmetricalness expresses stability and equilibrium
- 

### Solids

Shaped can be lofted, extruded, rotated, or revolved to form basic solids

#### Sphere

- The revolution of a circle
- Self centering in a 3D environment
- Can induce a movement when on an unlevel surface
- Remains the same from any viewpoint

#### Cylinder

- 

#### Cone

#### Pyramid

#### Cube
