# Primary Elements

Extending an element in a direction increases its **dimention**

## Dimentional Primitives

### Point

![[0 - Point]]

- Marks a position
- No ***size***, ***depth***, or ***area***
- Is **static**, **central**, and **directionless**
- Can mark **centers**, ends of lines, or corners
- Uncentered points create **aggression** and **tension**
	- Centered points creates **stability** and **rest**
- On a plan, points mark endings, openings, and columns

#### Point-like forms
![[0 - Point forms]]
- A point in 3D space can look like a circle, cylinder, or even a sphere. They have similar characteristics to points as marking areas as centers or to create tension.
- Two points creates both a line going **through** them and a perpendicular going **between** them

### Line

![[1 - Line]]
- lines **joi**
### Plane

![[2 - Plane]]

### Volume

![[3 - Volume]]
