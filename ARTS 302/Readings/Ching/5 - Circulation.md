# Circulation

People move through time through a **sequence** of **spaces**

## Approach

- The process of getting to or in a building
- Can be short or long
- Can be one of three types
  - **Frontal**: Directly facing and towards a building
  - **Oblique**: Proceeding towards a building at an extreme angle
  - **Spiral**: A path nearly completely around a building to show off its 3D characteristics

## Entrance

A figurative vertical plane that separates spaces from each other

- Usually a plane with an opening
- Perpendicular to the path of entry
- Can be one of three types
  - **Flush**: Flat with the separation plane
  - **Projected**: Protruded from the separation plane
  - **Recessed**: Recessed from the separation plane
- Can also be characterized by relative location on the plane
- Can be characterized by shape of entrance
- Can be reinforced by
  - Making it a non-standard size
  - Making it deep
  - Ornamenting the supports of the opening

## Configuration of the Path

- Different modes of transport have different capabilities of change in direction
	- Cars cannot turn quick
	- Bicycles are slightly more free
	- Walking can go in any direction
- Intersections are decisions
	- Should establish a dominant route to ease decisions
- Shapes of paths
	- **Linear**
		- Doesn't need to be straight
		- Sharp turns make interest
	- **Radial**
		- Paths extending from a singular point
	- **Spiral**
		- Single path that rotates around a point
	- **Grid**
		- Parallel lines and perpendicular lines
	- **Network**
		- Lines that connect interests in a plane of space
	- **Composite**
		- A mixture of the above

## Path-Space Relationship

- Paths can
	- **Pass by spaces**
		- Link spaces
		- maintains individuality
	- **Pass through spaces**
		- Creates movement within spaces
	- **Terminate in a space**
		- Signify the space

## Form of the Circulation Space

- Form of the circulation space varies by
	- Its boundaries
	- Linking spaces
	- Qualities of
		- Scale
		- Proportion
		- Light
		- View
	- Entrances
	- Elevation
- A circulation space could be
	- **Enclosed**
		- Forming a private area
	- **Open on one side**
		- Provides spacial continuity
	- **Open on both sides**
		- Becomes an extension of the spaces it links
- Narrow passages promote movement
	- Breakpoints and widenings may be added to relieve traffic
	- Large spaces have random paths
- Stairs change elevation
	- Steeper stairs forbid movement
	- Wider stairs are more inviting (including spilling landings)
	- Landings allow changes in directions
	- Can be one of a few configurations
		- Straight run
		- L-shaped
		- U-shaped
		- Circular
		- Spiral
