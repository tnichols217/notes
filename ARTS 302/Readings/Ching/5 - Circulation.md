# Circulation

People move through time through a **sequence** of **spaces**

## Approach

- The process of getting to or in a building
- Can be short or long
- Can be one of three types
  - **Frontal**: Directly facing and towards a building
  - **Oblique**: Proceeding towards a building at an extreme angle
  - **Spiral**: A path nearly completely around a building to show off its 3D characteristics

## Entrance

A figurative vertical plane that separates spaces from each other

- Usually a plane with an opening
- Perpendicular to the path of entry
- Can be one of three types
  - **Flush**: Flat with the separation plane
  - **Projected**: Protruded from the separation plane
  - **Recessed**: Recessed from the separation plane
- Can also be characterized by relative location on the plane
- Can be characterized by shape of entrance
- Can be reinforced by
  - Making it a non-standard size
  - Making it deep
  - Ornamenting the supports of the opening

## Configuration of the Path

- Different modes of transport have different capabilities of change in direction
	- Cars cannot turn quick
	- Bicycles are slightly more free
	- Walking can go in any direction
- Intersections are decisions
	- Should establish a dominant route to ease decisions
- Shapes of paths
	- **Linear**
		- Doesn't need to be straight
		- Sharp turns make interest
	- **Radial**
		- Paths extending from a singular point
	- **Spiral**
		- Single path that rotates around a point
	- **Grid**
		- Parallel lines and perpendicular lines
	- **Network**
		- Lines that connect interests in a plane of space
	- **Composite**
		- A mixture of the above
