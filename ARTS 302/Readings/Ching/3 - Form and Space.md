# Form and Space

Often we classify things in our vision as foreground and background, positive and negative. Positive space is what most people pay attention to, but negative space helps define positive space and there can be interest in negative space as well.

## Buildings interacting with Space

Buildings can interact with space in a variety of ways

1. Form a wall on one edge to define a positive outdoor space
2. Merge interior with a private outdoor space
3. Enclose a portion of the site as an outdoor "room" to shelter it
4. Be Introverted - Surround a courtyard within its volume
5. Be Extroverted - Dominate its site and be distinct in its space
6. Stretch out and present a broad face as to terminate an edge of a space
7. Stand free, but merge interior with private exterior spaces
8. Stand as a positive form in negative space

## Forms defining Space

### Horizontal Elements

#### Base Plane

If there is a perceptible difference in color, tone, or texture between the defining base plane and its surroundings, then it can act as a figure defining space.

- Stronger edge definition => distinct and stronger space
- Stronger the difference from surroundings => stronger space
- Generates vertical spacial zone above it
  - Often used as a tool to separate and define zones

#### Elevated Base Plane

Elevating a plane separates it from its surroundings and creates a space upon it.

- Change in elevation defines the edge of the plane
- More change in texture/color/tone => More separation from surroundings
- Can be in one of three categories
  1. Spatial and Visual continuity is maintained — each space is easily accessible from each other
  2. Only Visual continuity is maintained — physical access requires stairs
  3. Neither Spatial or Visual continuity is maintained — the planes are completely isolated from each other and provides shelter instead
    - Weakens the connection with the surrounding

#### Depressed Base Plane

Depressing a plane separates it from its surroundings and creates a space within it.

- Change in elevation defines the edge of the plane
- More change in texture/color/tone => More separation from surroundings
- Can be in one of three categories
  1. Spatial and Visual continuity is maintained — each space is easily accessible from each other
  2. Only Visual continuity is maintained — physical access requires stairs, weaker connection
  3. Neither Spatial or Visual continuity is maintained — the planes are completely isolated from each other and creates a room instead
    - Weakens the connection with the surrounding

#### Overhead Plane

Creates a space below it, separating it from the surroundings

- Form of roof can be made from different structural styles:
	- Wood Truss
	- Steel Joist
	- Masonry Vault
- Often reflects a similar style of the surroundings
- Can define zones below it

### Vertical Elements

- Takes up more visual space than horizontal elements
- Separate spaces inherently, and create a shared boundary
- Serve as supports and protection 

#### Vertical Linear

- Non-directional
- Creates a space around it
- Articulates surfaces or corners
- Defines central zones in an interior space

#### Multiple Vertical Linear

- Work together to create envisioned vertical planes
- Separate spaces from each other
- Reinforcing the base or ceiling will define a space better
- Grids can define zones and provide regularity

#### Single Vertical Plane

- Only defines a singular edge of a space
- Height makes a difference
	1. Short => Defines an edge
	2. Medium => Creation of enclosure
	3. High => Creation of Separation
	4. Very High => Complete separation of spaces
- Can be a point of orientation

#### L-Shaped Vertical Planes

- Has an introverted side and an extroverted side
- Defines two edges of a space
- Presence of void in one side of the corner will weaken its definition and will establish a more dominant wall
- If neither reach the corner, it creates a dynamic space and items organize across the diagonal
- Stable and self-supporting
- Strong space defining elements
- Can be meshed with itself
- Often used in buildings to enclose a small outdoor space

#### Parallel Vertical Planes

- Extroverted in nature, no corners
- Creates movement through open edges
- Can be reinforced with ground definition or overhead planes
- Can be extended with a detached terminal plane
- If planes are different, a flow from one to the other will be made

#### U-Shaped Vertical Planes

- Has an introverted side and an extroverted side
- Creates movement out of the corner
- Open side is the primary side of the space
- Can be reinforced with pillars, a detached plane, or overhead plane

#### Closure from 4 Planes

- Has no overhead plane
- One of the strongest space dividing method
- Organizes a perimeter
- Promotes community on the inside by creating a shared space
- Often are central and important

## Openings in Space-Defining Elements

- Provides continuity between spaces
- Allows light and ventilation to pass through

### Openings within Planes

- 

### Openings at Corners

### Openings between Planes

## Qualities of Architectural Space

### Degree of Enclosure

### Light

### View
