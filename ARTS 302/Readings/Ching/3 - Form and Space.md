# Form and Space

Often we classify things in our vision as foreground and background, positive and negative. Positive space is what most people pay attention to, but negative space helps define positive space and there can be interest in negative space as well.

## Buildings interacting with Space

Buildings can interact with space in a variety of ways

1. Form a wall on one edge to define a positive outdoor space
2. Merge interior with a private outdoor space
3. Enclose a portion of the site as an outdoor "room" to shelter it
4. Be Introverted - Surround a courtyard within its volume
5. Be Extroverted - Dominate its site and be distinct in its space
6. Stretch out and present a broad face as to terminate an edge of a space
7. Stand free, but merge interior with private exterior spaces
8. Stand as a positive form in negative space

## Forms defining Space

### Horizontal Elements

#### Base Plane

If there is a perceptible difference in color, tone, or texture between the defining base plane and its surroundings, then it can act as a figure defining space.

- Stronger edge definition => distinct and stronger space
- Stronger the difference from surroundings => stronger space
- Generates vertical spacial zone above it
  - Often used as a tool to separate and define zones

#### Elevated Base Plane

Elevating a plane separates it from its surroundings and creates a space upon it.

- Change in elevation defines the edge of the plane
- More change in texture/color/tone => More separation from surroundings
- Can be in one of three categories
  1. Spatial and Visual continuity is maintained — each space is easily accessible from each other
  2. Only Visual continuity is maintained — physical access requires stairs
  3. Neither Spatial or Visual continuity is maintained — the planes are completely isolated from each other and provides shelter instead
    - Weakens the connection with the surrounding

#### Depressed Base Plane

Depressing a plane separates it from its surroundings and creates a space within it.

- Change in elevation defines the edge of the plane
- More change in texture/color/tone => More separation from surroundings
- Can be in one of three categories
  1. Spatial and Visual continuity is maintained — each space is easily accessible from each other
  2. Only Visual continuity is maintained — physical access requires stairs, weaker connection
  3. Neither Spatial or Visual continuity is maintained — the planes are completely isolated from each other and creates a room instead
    - Weakens the connection with the surrounding

#### Overhead Plane

Creates a space below it, separating it from the surroundings

- Form of roof can be made from different structural styles:
	- Wood Truss
	- Steel Joist
	- Masonry Vault
- Often reflects a similar style of the surroundings
- Can define zones below it

### Vertical Elements

- Takes up more visual space than horizontal elements
- Separate spaces inherently, and create 

#### Single Vertical Plane

#### L-Shaped Vertical Planes

#### Parallel Vertical Planes

#### U-Shaped Vertical Planes

#### Enclosed Space from 4 Planes

## Openings in Space-Defining Elements

### Openings within Planes

### Openings at Corners

### Openings between Planes

## Qualities of Architectural Space

### Degree of Enclosure

### Light

### View
