# Form and Space

Often we classify things in our vision as foreground and background, positive and negative. Positive space is what most people pay attention to, but negative space helps define positive space and there can be interest in negative space as well.

## Buildings interacting with Space

Buildings can interact with space in a variety of ways
1. Form a wall on one edge to define a positive outdoor space
2. Merge interior with a private outdoor space
3. Enclose a portion of the site as an outdoor "room" to shelter it
4. Be Introverted - Surround a courtyard within its volume
5. Be Extroverted - Dominate its site and be distinct in its space
6. Stretch out and present a broad face as to terminate an edge of a space
7. Stand free, but merge interior with private exterior spaces
8. Stand as a positive form in negative space
