# Views
## Elevation
- Views from thee side of the building (or the side of the road)
- There is no perspective, it is orthographic
- There is no slicing in the elevation

## Plan
- The view of the walls from the top down view of the building
- No perspective, perfectly top down
- Heavy or filled in objects mean walls or solids that ascend upwards
- The slice is often chosen to give the most information about the interior of the building, like windows, doors, pillars, walls

### Psych Plan
- Overview of the buildings from the top down, without a roof
- Orhtographic

### Roof Plan
- Top down view of the building with a roof
- Used in construction drawings

## Section
- Viewing a slice of the building from the side to see what is going on in the inside
- Also no perspective
- Often in symmetrical buildings, the elevation and section are split on the same image
- Things that have been sliced are often left white, with uncut objects remaining dark
- Darker outlines tend to be more permanent, and lighter lines tend to be temporary or objects not being sliced
- Sections are labels on the plan so that we can see where they slice through the building

## Axonometric
- A view down from a corner of the building in 3 dimensions
- Is orthographic
- Is a type of isometric view

# Line Weight
## Heavy Lines
- Solid objects
- Objects being sliced

## Medium Lines
- Objects in the stance
- Non-permanent object

## Light Lines
- Details in objects

## Dashed lines
- Objects before the slice
