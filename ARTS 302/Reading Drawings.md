## Elevation
- Views from thee side of the building (or the side of the road)
- There is no perspective, it is orthogonal

## Plan
- The view of the walls from the top down view of the building
- No perspective, perfectly top down
- Heavy or filled in objects mean walls or solids that ascend upwards

## Section
- Viewing a slice of the building from the side to see what is going on in the inside
- Also no perspective
- Often in symmetrical buildings, the elevation and section are split on the same image
