## 1

What is your estimate of the accuracy to which you can make measurements with your scope, in terms of cm, mm or DIV?

## 2

What is your measured period and frequency (from counting divisions), with uncertainties, of the 1 kHz square wave calibration signal?

## 3

What is your measurement (by counting divisions) of the peak-to-peak voltage of the calibration signal?

## 4

Provide a sketch of the waveform obtained from the doorbell transformer, with appropriate scales on the horizontal and vertical axes. Also provide the period, frequency and peak-to-peak voltage of the signal obtained from your measurements.

## 5

What voltage did you measure for the doorbell transformer with your DMM? Is this consistent with the scope measurement? (Explain!)

## 6

Sketch your Lissajous pattern(s) at 60 Hz. (You should make more than 1 plot to show how this pattern changes during your observation.)

## 7

Sketch the pattern at 120 Hz.

## 8

What frequency between 60-120 Hz gives another clear Lissajous pattern?

## 9

Sketch the pattern at this intermediate frequency.

## 10

What conditions are necessary to observe Lissajous patterns?

## 11

What is the tuning fork frequency you measured from your scope?
