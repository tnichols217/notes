For section D.3, Long Wire:

Attach a copy of one of the LoggerPro plots and your graph to this worksheet:

Report your value for the exponent of the power law as a measurement interval.
Is this consistent with the theoretical value? Explain.

> We got a value of $-0.76\pm0.05$, which is not exactly close to $1$, but is still within $5$ STD of our expected value.

For section D.4, Coils:

Attach a copy of your graph to this worksheet:

Report your value for the exponent of the power law as a measurement interval.

For section D.5, Disk Magnet:

Attach a copy of your graph to this worksheet:

Report your value for the exponent of the power law as a measurement interval.  
Compare this value to your value for the coil.

For section D.2.2, with the rectangular coil:

What was the largest (positive or negative) induced EMF you found for:

#### i

motion of the coil outside the magnet, about 40 cm away

> [!answer]
> Roughly $-0.011~V$

#### ii

motion over the magnet with coil ends kept from crossing the boundary

> [!answer]
> Roughly $-0.021~V$

#### iii - iv

40 cm-to-center motion, center-to-40 cm
Explain why the sign of the EMF change between these two directions.

Record the values of the integrals for each part of the motion (Don’t forget units.)

40 cm-to-center motion, center-to-40 cm
Why should these two integrals be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign
Remember to attach a copy of your LoggerPro scan for measurement iii.

Record the maximum magnitude of the EMF for your two other speeds?

Motion 40 cm to center: slower, faster
Motion center to 40 cm: slower, faster

Explain why the magnitude changed with speed.

Record the value of the integral over time of the EMF for fast motion, slow motion

Are the integrals for the two different speeds the same? Should they be? Explain why or why not.

> 
> Since magnetic flux is conservative, its path integral will remain the same no matter what path is taken from initial point to ending point.
> 
> This also means that the reverse path will have the inverse integral.
> 
> The magnitude changes with speed as only the integral is conserved. Spreading out the integral over time will decrease its magnitude in order to preserve the integral.
> 
> The integrals should be the same as they start and end at the same points. They are roughly similar in magnitude to each other, but they are slightly different due to error in integration and human error.

#### v

Record the values of the integrals for
Moving the coil onto the magnet, lifting it up and back

Are these values equal but opposite? Is this behavior expected? Explain why or why not.

> [!answer]
> Onto: $0.08035~Vs$
> Up: $-0.0829~Vs$
> 
> This is expected, as the path does not matter, only the start and end points do.

For section D.3 with rotating coils: (Attach a copy of the printout as requested.)
Record the values of the integrated areas for the 90º flips? (average of two values)
Fast, Slow

Record the average time integral for your four 180° flips
Determine the strength of the magnet from these flips

Section D.4 - Coupled circuits

Explain the shape of the induced waveform in relation to the input waveform.
What are the EMFs for the coils with different number of turns at 20Hz?

16 turn, 160 turn, 1600 turn

Compare this behavior to theory.

> [!answer]
> For the sine waves, the inputs and outputs looked very similar.
> For square waves, the output looked like a square wave but each peak died off faster than the input.
> 
> For our 16, 160, 1600 turn tests we obtained:
> ![[PHYS 122 - Physics 2/Lab/5/tables#^3|tables]]
> 
> This is in line with theory as the voltage is proportional with cross section area and number of turns, so as the number of turns increase the induced voltage also increases.
