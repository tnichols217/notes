## 1 Equilibrium of a Square

Four charges are placed at the vertices of a diagonal square with side of length $a$ and a fifth charge is placed at the center. The corner charges each have the same charge $q$; the central charge is $Q$.

### a

What is the total electrostatic force on the central charge?

> [!answer]
> $\vec0$ as it cancels out.

### b

What is the total electrostatic force on the charge at the vertex $A$ (top)? Your answer may depend on $q$, $Q$, $4\pi\epsilon_0$, $a$ and the unit vectors $\hat i$ and $\hat j$.

> [!answer]
> $F_{Elr}=\sqrt2 \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{a^{2}}\hat j$ via symmetry, trig, and additivity
> $F_{Eb}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{2a^{2}}\hat j$
> $F_{Ec}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{2Q}{a^{2}}\hat j$
> 
> $F_e=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{(\sqrt 2+0.5) q+2Q}{a^{2}} \hat j$
> $\square$

### c

Write down the total force on each of the other three corner charges also. [Hint: Use your result of part (b) and symmetry to write down the answer. No calculation is needed].

> [!answer]
> Let $F_e=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{(\sqrt 2+0.5) q+2Q}{a^{2}}$
> $F_{et}=F_{e}\hat j$
> $F_{eb}=-F_{e}\hat j$
> $F_{el}=-F_{e}\hat i$
> $F_{er}=F_{e}\hat i$
> $F_{ec}=0$
> $\square$

### d

What value should the central charge $Q$ have in order that the forces on all five charges are exactly zero?

> [!answer]
> $F_e=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{(\sqrt 2+0.5) q+2Q}{a^{2}}$
> $F_e=0\iff(\sqrt 2+0.5) q+2Q=0$
> $Q=-\frac{2\sqrt 2 + 1}{4}q$
> $\square$

## 2 Field of a semi-circular arc

A semi-circular arc in the $+y$ half of radius $R$ has a charge per unit length $\lambda$. We wish to compute the electric field $\vec E$ at $P$, the center of the arc.

### a

What is the total charge of the arc?

> [!answer]
> $l=\pi R$
> $c=\lambda l$
> $c=\pi R\lambda$

### b

In what direction does $\vec E$ point? Explain briefly.

> [!answer]
> It will either point $\hat j$ or $-\hat j$ depending on the sign of $\lambda$ as it is horizontally symmetric, meaning there will be no horizontal force at point $P$

### c

Consider the infinitesimal segment of arc located at an angle $\theta$ from the x-axis. $d\theta$ is the angle subtended by this segment at $P$ as shown in figure 3.

#### i

What is the charge of this segment?

> [!answer]
> The charge will be $R\lambda d\theta$

#### ii

What is the distance of this segment from $P$?

> [!answer]
> $R$

#### iii

Write down the displacement vector $\vec r$ from the segment to $P$. Give your answer in terms of $R$, $\theta$, $\hat i$ and $\hat j$.

> [!answer]
> $-R(\hat i\cos\theta+\hat j\sin\theta)$

#### iv

Using Coulomb’s law write down the electric field $d\vec E$ at $P$ that is produced by the infinitesimal arc segment.

> [!answer]
> $-R(\hat i\cos\theta+\hat j\sin\theta)\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{R\lambda d\theta}{R^{2}}$
> $-(\hat i\cos\theta+\hat j\sin\theta)\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \lambda d\theta$
> $\square$

### d

By integration of the result of part (c) determine $\vec E_x$, the x-component of the total electric field at $P$.

> [!answer]
> $\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}-(\hat i\cos\theta)\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \lambda d\theta$
> $=0$
> $\square$

### e

By integration of the result of part (c) determine $\vec E_y$, the y-component of the total electric field at $P$.

> [!answer]
> $\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}-(\hat j\sin\theta)\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \lambda d\theta$
> $=\frac{-\lambda}{2\pi \epsilon_{0}}$
> $\square$

## 3 Field of a charged strip

An infinite strip of width $2a$ lies in the $yz$ plane symmetrically about the $z$-axis. The strip has a uniform surface charge density $\sigma$ and we are interested in the electric field at the point $P$, $x$ units on the $x_+$-axis. To calculate the field we will mentally subdivide the strip into narrow strips of infinitesimal width $dy$.

### a

In what direction do you expect the field at $P$ to point? Briefly explain your reasoning.

> [!answer]
> Either in the $+\hat i$ direction or the $-\hat i$ direction depending on the sign of $\sigma$

### b

What is the charge per unit length of the infinitely long narrow strip?

> [!answer]
> $\sigma dy$

### c

What is the electric field at $P$ due to the narrow strip? [Hint: The narrow strip may be regarded as a line of charge. Use the result for the field of a line of charge derived in class].

> [!answer]
> $\frac{x\sigma}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \int\limits_{y=-a}^a\int\limits_{z=-\infty}^\infty\frac{dz~dy}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$
> $\frac{x\sigma}{2\pi \epsilon_{0}} \int\limits_{y=-a}^a\frac{dy}{x^2+y^2}$
> $\frac{\sigma}{\pi \epsilon_{0}}\arctan\left( \frac{a}{x} \right)$
> $\square$

### d

Integrate your result of part (c) to obtain the total electric field at point $P$.

> [!answer]
> $\frac{\sigma}{\pi \epsilon_{0}}\arctan\left( \frac{a}{x} \right)$
> $\square$

### e

What electric field do you expect at $P$ in the limit that $a >> x$? Does your answer in
part (d) reduce to the expected result? [Hint: tan−1 ξ ≈ π/2 for ξ ≫ 1].

> [!answer]
> $\lim\limits_{a\to\infty}\frac{\sigma}{\pi \epsilon_{0}}\arctan\left( \frac{a}{x} \right)$
> $=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$
> 
> This makes sense as it would approach an infinite sheet.

### f

What electric field do you expect at $P$ in the limit that $a << x$? Does your answer in
part (d) reduce to the expected result? [Hint: tan−1 ξ ≈ ξ for ξ ≪ 1].

> [!answer]
> $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\frac{\sigma}{\pi \epsilon_{0}}\arctan\left( \frac{a}{x} \right)$
> $=0$
> 
> This makes sense as the sheet would approach relatively 0 width w.r.t. the point.
