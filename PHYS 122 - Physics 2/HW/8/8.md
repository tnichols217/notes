## 1

Assume that the rod in the figure below has a length of $0.86m$, the resistor has value $2.2\ohm$, and a magnetic field of $8.0T$ is directed into the page. The rod and rails have negligible resistance. The rod is pulled to the left at constant speed.

### a

What speed will produce a current of $1.5A$ in the resistor?

> [!answer]
> $\epsilon=vBd$
> $\epsilon=v(8.0)(0.86)$
> $V=IR$
> $V=(1.5)(2.2)$
> $(1.5)(2.2)=v(8.0)(0.86)$
> $\frac{(1.5)(2.2)}{(8.0)(0.86)}=v$
> $v=0.4797~ \frac{m}{s}$
> $\square$

### b

In what direction does the current flow?

> [!answer]
> Counterclockwise, as it's induced field opposes the original field.

### c

What pulling force must be applied to maintain a steady current?

> [!answer]
> $F=IdB$
> $F=10.32~N$
> $\square$

## 2

A long rectangular conducting loop of width $25 cm$ is partially in a region of a horizontal magnetic field of $1.8T$ perpendicular to the loop as shown in the figure below. The mass of the loop is $12 g$, and its resistance is $0.17\ohm$. If the loop is released, what is its terminal velocity? Assume that the top of the loop stays in the magnetic field. (Hint: The terminal velocity occurs when the magnetic force on the induced current is equal in magnitude to the gravitational force.)

> [!answer]
> $F_{g}=mg$
> $F_{l}=IwB$
> $I=\frac{mg}{wB}$
> 
> $V=IR$
> $V=\frac{mgR}{wB}$
> $vBw=\frac{mgR}{wB}$
> $v=\frac{mgR}{w^{2}B^{2}}$
> $v=0.09883~ \frac{m}{s}$
> $\square$

## 3

A circular loop of wire is placed in a magnetic field of $0.30 T$ while the free ends of the wire are attached to a $15\ohm$ resistor as shown in the figure below. When you squeeze the loop, the area of the loop is reduced at a constant rate from $200$ to $100$ $cm^{2}$ in $0.020 s$. What are the magnitude and direction of the current in the resistor?

> [!answer]
> $\epsilon=-\frac{BdA}{dt}=B\frac{0.01}{0.02}$
> $V=IR$
> $I=B\frac{0.01}{0.02R}$
> $I=0.01~A$
> $\square$

## 4

A square loop of wire with side length $12cm$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field of strength $2T$. Initially $\vec B$ and $\vec A$ are parallel. At $t = 0$ the loop begins to spin about its axis with angular velocity $\omega = 1rad/s$ (see below). Plot the EMF through this loop from $t = 0$ to $t = 7$ seconds.

> [!answer]
> $\epsilon=-\frac{AB\hat n\cdot \hat B}{dt}$
> $\hat n\cdot\hat B=\cos t$
> $\epsilon=-\frac{AB\cos t}{dt}$
> $\epsilon=AB\sin t$
> $\epsilon=(0.12)^{2}(2)\sin t$
> $\epsilon=0.0288\sin t$
> $\square$

## 5

A circular wire loop of radius $r$ and total resistance $R$ is placed inside a region of uniform magnetic field that has magnitude given by $B = B_{0} \sin(\omega t)$. $\vec B$ and $\vec A$ are parallel. Find the induced magnetic field (the magnetic field only from the wire loop) produced at the center of the wire loop at any given time $t$. Describe the phase offset between the two fields.

> [!answer]
> $B = B_{0} \sin(\omega t)$
> $\epsilon=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}$
> $\epsilon=-\frac{AB_{0} \sin(\omega t)}{dt}$
> $\epsilon=-\omega AB_{0} \cos(\omega t)$
> $I=-\frac{\omega AB_{0}}{R} \cos(\omega t)$
> $\vec B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}(-\frac{\omega AB_{0}}{R} \cos(\omega t))\oint\frac{d\vec l\times\vec r}{r^{3}}$
> $B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\left( -\frac{\omega AB_{0}}{R} \cos(\omega t) \right)\oint \frac{2\pi}{r^{2}}$
> $B=\left( -\frac{\omega \mu_{0}AB_{0}}{2Rr^{2}} \cos(\omega t) \right)$
> $B=-\frac{\omega \mu_{0}\pi B_{0}}{2R} \cos(\omega t)$
> $\square$
> In the direction opposite the original magnetic field.
