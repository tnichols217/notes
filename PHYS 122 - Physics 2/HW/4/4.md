Energy of a dipole

### a*

Dipole moment

An ideal electric dipole moment is a pair of equal and opposite charges $+q$ and $-q$ separated by a distance $a$. The “dipole moment” of the pair is a vector $\vec p$ defined as $\vec p = q\vec r$ where $\vec r$ is the displacement vector from the negative to the positive charge. The magnitude of the dipole moment is $qa$.

### b

Force on a dipole

Consider a dipole moment immersed in a uniform electric field $\vec E$. What is the total force on the dipole?

> [!answer]
> $0$ as whatever force effects one will have the opposite effect on the other.

### c

Torque on a dipole

Assume the negative charge is at the origin and the position of the positive charge is $\vec r$. Assume that the dipole is immersed in a uniform electric field $\vec E$. What is the torque on the dipole? Give your answer in terms of $\vec p$ and $\vec E$.

> [!answer]
> $F_{-}=-q\vec E$
> $F_{+}=q\vec E$
> 
> $\tau_{-}=\frac{q}{2}\vec r\times\vec E$
> $\tau_{+}=\frac{q}{2}\vec r\times\vec E$
> 
> $\tau=q\vec r\times \vec E$
> $\tau=\vec p\times \vec E$

### d

Electrostatic Energy

Again assume that the negative charge is at the origin and the position of the positive charge is $\vec r$.

Assume that the dipole is immersed in a uniform electric field $\vec E$. What is the electrostatic potential energy of the dipole? Give your answer in terms of $\vec p$ and $\vec E$.

Hint: Recall that for a charge $Q$ at position $\vec R$ in a uniform electric field $\vec E\hat k$ the electrostatic energy is $-Q\vec E \cdot \vec R$

> [!answer]
> $U=q\vec E\cdot \vec r+0$
> $U=\vec E\cdot \vec p$

> 
> $\vec E(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{zq}{(R^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\hat k$
> $\vec E'(z)=\frac{\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}-3z^{2}\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{1/2}}{\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3}}$
> $\vec E'(z)=0$
> $\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}=3z^{2}\left(R^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{1/2}$
> $R^{2}+z^{2}=3z^{2}$
> $z=\pm\sqrt\frac{R^{2}}{2}$
> $\square$

Here $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}$ is the magnitude of $\vec r$

You may use the approximation:

### a

The Ring: A ring of radius $r$ has a charge $q$.

The charge is distributed uniformly around the circumference of the ring. Determine the electrostatic potential $\phi$ at the point $P$ that lies on the axis of the ring at a distance $z$ from the center of the ring.

> [!answer]
> $\phi(z)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}\frac{qd\theta}{2\pi}$
> $\phi(z)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}$
> $\square$

### b

The Disc

Now consider a uniformly charged disc with a radius $R$ and a surface charge per unit area $\sigma$. We wish to determine the potential at a point that lies on the axis of the disc at a distance $z$ from the center of the disc.

#### i

To this end first consider the infinitesimal annulus of the inner radius $r$ and outer radius $r + dr$. Determine the charge of this annulus. Determine the potential at $P$ due to this infinitesimal annulus.

Hint: Use your result of part (a)

 > [!answer]
 > $A=\pi(r+dr)^{2}-\pi r^{2}$
 > $=\pi(2rdr+dr^2)$
 > 
> $\phi(z)=\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0}\frac{\sigma rdr}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}$
> $\square$

#### ii

Now integrate the result of part (i) to obtain the potential at $P$ due to the disc.

Helpful integral:
$\int dr\frac{2r}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}=2\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}$

> [!answer]
> $\phi(z)=\int\limits_{0}^{R}\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0}\frac{\sigma rdr}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}}$
> $\phi(z)=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}\bigg|_{0}^{R}$
> $\phi(z)=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\left(\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}-z\right)$
> $\square$

#### iii

What form do you expect the potential to have for $z \gg R$.

Explain briefly. Does your result of part (ii) reduced to the expected result?

Helpful approximation: For $z \gg R$
$\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}\approx z+\frac{R^{2}}{2z}$

> [!answer]
> I expect it to go to $0$ as $\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}-z\to0$
> 
> $\phi(z)=\frac{\sigma R^2}{4z\epsilon_0}$
> $\square$

Spherical capacitor

A conducting sphere (radius $a$) is surrounded by a spherical conducting shell (inner radius $b$, outer radius $c$). The inner sphere has a charge $+q$; the outer shell has a charge $-q$. Throughout this problem $r$ denotes distance from the center of the sphere.

### a

What is the electric field inside the conducting sphere (for $r < a$)?

> [!answer]
> $\vec E=\vec 0$ inside perfect conductors always

### b

Where is the charge located on the conducting sphere: in the interior or on the surface? What is the surface charge density?

> [!answer]
> The surface, by Gauss law, for any shell smaller than the radius of the sphere, since $\vec E=\vec 0$, it must enclose no charge.
> 
> $Q_{enc}=q$
> $\phi=\frac{q}{4\pi r^{2}\epsilon_{0}}$

### c

Determine the electric field in the gap between the sphere and the shell (for $a < r < b$)

Hint: Apply Gauss’s law to the inner Gaussian surface depicted in the figure.

> [!answer]
> $Q_{enc}=q$
> $\phi=\frac{q}{4\pi r^{2}\epsilon_{0}}$
> 
> $\vec E=\frac{d\phi}{dr}=\frac{-q}{2\pi r^{3}\epsilon_{0}}\hat r$
> $\square$

### d

What is the electric field within the conducting shell (for $b < r < c$)?

> [!answer]
> $\vec E=\vec 0$ inside perfect conductors always

### e

Where is the charge located in the conducting shell? In the interior? On the inner surface? On the outer surface? Or divided in some proportion between the inner surface and the outer surface? Explain briefly.

Hint: Apply Gauss’s law to the outer Gaussian surface depicted in the figure

> [!answer]
> At the inner surface, because $\vec E=\vec 0$ within the shell, so the charge enclosed by any Gausian surface within this shell must be $0$
> 
> Since the sphere has charge of $+q$, and $q_{enc}=0$ past any radius above the inner surface, the inner surface must have charge $-q$, thus the whole charge will be on the inner surface.

### f

What is the potential difference between the outer shell and the inner sphere?

Hint: Recall that the potential difference between two points $\vec r_{1}$ and $\vec r_{2}$ is given by

$V_{1}-V_{2}=-\int\limits_{\vec  r_{1}}^{\vec r_{2}}\vec E\cdot d\vec l$

where the integral is evaluated along any path that runs from point 1 to point 2.

> [!answer]
> $V_{outer}-V_{sphere}=\int\limits_{a\hat r}^{b\hat r}\frac{d}{dr}\left( \frac{q}{4\pi r^{2}\epsilon_{0}} \right)\cdot d\vec l+\int\limits_{b\hat r}^{c\hat r}0\cdot \vec l$
> $\Delta V=\frac{q}{4\pi r^{2}\epsilon_{0}}\bigg|_{a}^{b}$
> $\Delta V=\frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\left(b^{-2}-a^{-2}\right)$
> $\square$

### g

A pair of conductors with equal and opposite charge constitute a capacitor. The capacitance of the capacitor is defined as $C = \frac{q}{V}$. Here $q$ is the charge on the positively charged conductor and $V$ is the potential difference between the positively charged conductor and the negatively charged conductor. Calculate $C$ for the spherical capacitor analyzed in this problem.

> [!answer]
> $q=+q$
> $V=\frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\left(b^{-2}-a^{-2}\right)$
> 
> $C=4\pi \epsilon_{0}\left(b^{-2}-a^{-2}\right)^{-1}$
> $\square$
