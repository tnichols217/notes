What is the circulation of the magnetic field around the Amperian loop shown in the figure? Give your answer in terms of $B$, the magnitude of the magnetic field along the top and bottom segments of the loop, and $w$ and $l$

> $\oint d\vec l\cdot\vec B=2Bw$
> $\mu_{0}\kappa w=2Bw$
> $B= \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}\kappa$

A rectangular loop of dimensions $a\times b$ is pulled into a region with a uniform magnetic field from a region with zero magnetic field as shown in the figure. Thus $\vec B=B\hat k$ for $y\ge 0$ and $B = 0$ for $y < 0$. Assume the loop moves at a uniform velocity $\vec v = v\hat j$. Let $\epsilon$ represent the y-coordinate of the top of the loop.
