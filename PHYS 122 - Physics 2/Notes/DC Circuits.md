# DC Circuits

## Kirchoff's Rules

- Potential drop $V$ around a loop is always $0$.
- Junctions add current. $C=C_{1}+C_{2}$

## Components

### Batteries

Has a constant $\epsilon$

Maintains a voltage difference across it of $\epsilon$

$dU=dq\epsilon$
$P=I\epsilon$

### Resistors

Has a constant $R$, in $\ohm$

$dU=dq(-IR)$
$P=I^{2}R$

#### Ohm's Law

$V=IR$

Where $V$ is the voltage across the resistor and $I$ is the current through the resistor.
