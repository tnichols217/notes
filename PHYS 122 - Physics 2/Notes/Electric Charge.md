 # Electric Charges

There are two types of charges: positive and negative.

Opposites attract, and similar charges repel each other.

Metals are **conductors**, so charges flow freely across the medium. Conversely, plastics and crystals are **insulators**, so charge does not distribute across the medium.

>**Triboelectricity**: transferring charge through friction

Charge is always conserved and a multiple of $e=1.6*10^{-19}~C$ per electron

## The Coulombs force

The Coulombs force dictates the force between two charged particles

$F=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{qQ}{r^{2}}$

Where $Q$ and $q$ are the charges of the two particles
Similarly signed $q$s will have a repulsive force

## Law of Electrostatics

The charges from a particle at rest

Electric fields push charges

$|\vec E|=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}$

## Gauss Law

$\Sigma\phi\propto Q_{enc}$

$\Sigma\phi=\frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{0}}$

The sum of potential across an arbitrary enclosing surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.

### Gauss Law: Spheres

With sphere of radius $R$
At point $r$ distance away from the center of the sphere
And charge density of $\rho$

$r<R\to E=\frac{\rho r}{3\epsilon_0}$
$r>R\to E=\frac{\rho }{3\epsilon_{0}} \frac{R^3}{r^2}$

## Electrostatic energy

Two points that are $r$ apart with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ has an electric potential of:

$U_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}$

### Potential within a field

The potential of a point charge within a uniform field $\vec E$ is:

$-Q\vec E \cdot \vec R$

Where $\vec R$ is the location of the point charge

## Charge of a perfect conductor

Since the internals of a perfect conductor always have $\vec E=\vec 0$

Its surface charge must always be

$\sigma=\epsilon_{0}\vec E$
