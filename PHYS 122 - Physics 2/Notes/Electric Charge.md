# Electric Charges

There are two types of charges: positive and negative.

Opposites attract, and similar charges repel each other.

Metals are **conductors**, so charges flow freely across the medium. Conversely, plastics and crystals are **insulators**, so charge does not distribute across the medium.

>**Triboelectricity**: transferring charge through friction

Charge is always conserved and a multiple of $e=1.6*10^{-19}~C$ per electron

## The Coulombs force

The Coulombs force dictates the force between two charged particles

$F=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{qQ}{r^{2}}$

Where $Q$ and $q$ are the charges of the two particles
Similarly signed $q$s will have a repulsive force

## Law of Electrostatics

The charges from a particle at rest

Electric fields push charges

$|\vec E|=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}$
