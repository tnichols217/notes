# Magnetic Fields

## Lorentz Force

$\vec F=q\vec v\times\vec B$

Where $q$ is the electric charge of the point, $\vec v$ is its velocity, and $\vec B$ is the magnetic field.

$d\vec F=I~d\vec l\times \vec B$
$\vec F=I\int d\vec l\times \vec B$

## Biot-Savart

$d\vec B=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}I\frac{d\vec l\times\vec r}{r^{3}}$

## Magnetic Moment

$\vec m=ia\hat p$
Where $i$ is the current in the loop, $a$ is the area of the loop, and $\vec p$ is the right hand perpendicular direction to the loop following the current.

$\vec \tau_{net} = \vec m \times \vec B$

## Trajectory of a charge in a magnetic field

Since magnetic fields are always perpendicular to the movement of a charge, it never increase or decreases a charge's speed.

In a uniform magnetic field, a charge that moves perpendicular to the magnetic field will move in circular motion.

$qvB=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$ By applying the acceleration of centripetal forces.
$r=\frac{mv}{qB}$

$T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}=\frac{2\pi m}{qB}$
$\omega=\frac{qB}{m}$

## Gauss Law of Magnetism

$\Phi_{B}=\oint \vec n\cdot \vec B~da=0$

The flux of the magnetic field across any surface is always 0.

## Ampere's Law

The integration of the circulation of a wire's magnetic field will be proportional to the current in the wire.
$\oint d\vec l\cdot\vec B=\mu_{0}I$

## Faraday's Flux Rule

$\epsilon=vBd$ For railguns
$\epsilon=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}$
