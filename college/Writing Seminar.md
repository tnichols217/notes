> # Stop Googling. Let's Talk

> This except from Sherry Turkle's "Stop Googling. Let's Talk" outlines the various effects of the usage of phones during face-to-face conversations. Turkle claims that the usage of phones during face-to-face conversation decreases the quality of the in-person conversation, which in turn prevents the topic of conversation from ever diving any deeper than surface level. She argues that this is due to people incorrectly believing that they have the ability to multitask by both participating in the conversation whilst being active on their phone. This reduction in concentration on the physical conversation leads to the decrease in quality.

> I agree with Turkle's line of reasoning in that the usage of phones during conversation decrease the quality of the conversation, but I believe the root cause of this issue dives much deeper than the presence of phones only during conversation. It is evident and proven that humans can never truly "multitask" in the sense of giving meaningful thought to two topics simultaneously. Much like a computer with only one core, it never truly does multiple operations at the same time, but can switch between operations repeatedly. Whilst the same is true of humans, many still seem to believe that they have the ability to give their attention to multiple things at once, which in the case of conversation and phones, cripples both interactions due to missing important details while your mind is off somewhere else.
