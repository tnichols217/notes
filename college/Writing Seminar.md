> - people claim they know how to multitask
> 	- Leads to reduction in concentration of both tasks
> - Most people use their phones at social gatherings, yet most people also said phones hurt social gatherings
> - Reduction of time on phone during conversation improves face to face conversation quality
> - The presence of a phone disconnects people and keeps conversation topics light

> # Stop Googling. Let's Talk

> This except from Sherry Turkle's "Stop Googling. Let's Talk" outlines the various effects of the usage of phones during face-to-face conversations. Turkle claims that the usage of phones during face-to-face conversation decreases the quality of the in-person conversation, which in turn prevents the topic of conversation from ever diving any deeper than surface level. She argues that this is due to people incorrectly believing that they have the ability to multitask by both participating in the conversation whilst being active on their phone. This reduction in concentration on the physical conversation leads to the decrease in quality.

> I agree with Turkle's line of reasoning in that the usage of phones during conversation decrease the quality of the conversation, but I believe the root cause of this issue dives much deeper than the presence of phones only during conversation. It is evident and proven that humans can never truly "multitask" in the sense of giving meaningful thought to two topics simultaneously. Much like a computer with only one core, it never truly does multiple operations at the same time, but can switch between operations repeatedly. Whilst the same is true of humans, many still seem to believe that they have the ability to give their attention to multiple things at once, which in the case of conversation and phones, cripples both interactions due to missing important details while your mind is off somewhere else.

> Another growing problem with the modern generation is the idea of Dopamine addiction. On the topic of the presence of phones, Turkle states "You can put your attention wherever you want it to be. You can always be heard. You never have to be bored." The idea that entertainment and dopamine is readily available at any time essentially destructs any attention span that the modern generation may have. This similar degradation in attention length has similar effects of not giving your full attention when "multitasking" and similarly decreases conversation quality.
> 
> I believe that attention and depth of conversation are strongly linked to conversation quality. The statistics that Turkle provides on both usage of phones during social gatherings and opinions on their effects on conversation become painfully logical when you consider the effects the presence of phones. Intermittent attention from multitasking leads directly to a reduction in depth of conversation combined with the reduction in attention span collectively strongly decrease conversation quality.
