# 🟩 Bowdoin
To be at home in all lands and all ages;
to count Nature a familiar acquaintance,
and Art an intimate friend;
To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work
And the criticism of your own;
to carry the keys of the world's library in your pocket,
and feel its resources behind you in whatever task you undertake;
to make hosts of friends...who are to be leaders in all walks of life;
to lose yourself in generous enthusiasms and cooperate with others for common ends –
this is the offer of the college for the best four years of your life.

1. Which line from the Offer resonates most with you? (250 words)

To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work and the criticism of your own;

## 🟩

> [!para]
> Being able to appreciate other people's work stuck out to me in particular because of the implication of thoughtfulness, respect, and community. These ideas are only solidified by the end of the line: "and the criticism of your own". Although the rest of the piece alludes to similar ideas: being home, art and nature being friends, making friends, and cooperation, the expression of these ideals were not expressed as elegantly nor subtly as in this line. Although community is highly valued by me, respect in this community is arguably equally as important, which is not as strongly expressed in any other line of this poem. Being from Asian culture, respect is very well defined and understood by everyone. A community without respect means nothing. Not being able to understand and appreciate each other practically removes all aspects of a healthy community, and this line expresses that concisely among the descriptions of community in other lines. Lastly, I resonate with the idea of thoughtfulness and time well spent. Very often in the modern world do we forget to take a step back and spend time thinking, processing, and appreciating other people's ideas and works. I came to the important realization that thoughtful works demand thoughtful appreciation while walking through art galleries, looking at artwork that was very unfamiliar to me. This line well expresses the need for thoughtfulness and appreciation, as well as criticism, of works.

Please share your thoughts on **one (1) of the following prompts**. (300 words)   
  
- Carleton’s [community plan for inclusion, diversity, and equity](https://www.carleton.edu/inclusion/) aims to nurture and develop an even stronger community where students, faculty, and staff belong and thrive. How might you contribute to a sense of belonging at Carleton?

> [!para]
> Born to an American father and Malaysian mother, I have grown up understanding and balancing different cultures. My parents teach in a non-profit American international school in Malaysia where I am privileged to attend along with peers from over twenty five nations. On a broader scope, I live in a multicultural country that is made up of three predominant ethnicities. Living in this environment, I learned that unity and harmony exist from understanding and not tolerance. Tolerance suggests enduring or "putting up with" while understanding implies that there is nothing to “endure”, and that existing in harmony within a community of different beliefs and practices is one out of respect and acceptance. Once, my school rolled out a personality test that groups personalities by colors. That made me understand why some “blue” teachers can spend a whole block talking about feelings when something tragic happened, and why my “green” principle can come off as serious and goal oriented. It doesn’t mean that the “blue” teacher is not focused on academics, or the “green” principle is uncaring, they just have different personalities. I see culture the same way, if I understand the “personalities” of culture, acceptance of each other’s beliefs and practices becomes natural.

- Before graduation, every Carleton student completes a senior project, known as “comps.” [Comps projects](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/explore/education/comps/) take many different forms: a few recent examples are formal research papers, public presentations, and even a live staging of a theater production. Based on your current academic interests, what type of comps project or topic would you explore, and why? (No pressure, we won’t hold you to this!)  

- [Traditions at Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/explore/outside-class/traditions/) center around building and appreciating community. Some examples include the new student frisbee toss, Friday flowers, and baking cookies at Dacie Moses House. If you were tasked with creating a new Carleton tradition, what would you propose and how would you emphasize community within your idea?*

# 🌮 Dartmouth
1. Dartmouth celebrates the ways in which its profound sense of place informs its profound sense of purpose.

The focus on not only education but also research in today's very relevant fields attract me to take part in fields that I would not otherwise be interested in knowing about. Not only does Dartmouth provide resources and encourage research, it cultures entrepreneurship. For several years now I have been interested in learning how to create and produce products, exemplified through my bagel business, and Dartmouth's strong emphasis on entrepreneurship would only reinforce this ideal in me.

"That is what we are put on the earth for." In what ways do you hope to make—or are you making—an impact?

What drives you to create and what do you hope to make or have you made?

> I want to make computing transparent and portable again. Lately there have been so much de-standardization in the computing sector, where products that fulfill the same purpose are completely incompatible with each other, capturing and locking in the customers. Although this is good from a business point of view, it is a highly anti-consumerist principle. I envision a world where interconnect-ability is a given and not a feature. I would work not only towards setting and maintaining standards, but also by innovating in its respective field by showing the true benefits of modular design. People often believe that standards are a box to fit into and would hurt creativity and stifle innovation, but standards truly just set a baseline from where you should improve and innovate. So much that we take for granted in the modern age is provided by modular design. When I was designing my own operating system from the kernel up, I was amazed at how many options for everything there were: the kernel itself, shell interpreters, desktop environments, display managers, drivers, and just the configuration and styling of everything. As a programmer, looking inside and trying to change things and modify things to my liking is proven to be much simpler when modular in nature. I wish that all reasonable things would be able to follow a similar philosophy: ultimately, stylistic and operational choice should be up to the user/consumer, and modules provide just the interface to provide that.

# 🟩 Haverford
1. Tell us about a topic or issue that sparks your curiosity and gets you intellectually excited. How do you think the environment at Haverford and the framework of the Honor Code would foster your continued intellectual growth? (250 words)

## 🟩

> [!para]
> I love the interaction of modular systems. Learning how completely different things can interface and function in unison always seemed so surprising so me. Particularly in the computer science / computer engineering area, over the past few years this process has been steadily demystifying itself to me yet it still remains interesting and intriguing. Although modular design has its own benefits and drawbacks, I find how modules may be interchanged as long as it fits the form and function beneficial not only for maintainability but also in a sense of freedom. Freedom to choose and build your own system with modules of your choice. I find Haverford's honor code to provide the same freedom. Although unintuitive that a set of rules may provide freedom, this document (not just a set of rules) demystifies the purpose of everything, when it is simply created by the students themselves. Haverford's honor code would provide a safe and beneficial system of which would push new innovations and creations without the worry of doing it wrong.

### 🟩

> [!para]
> This year I am taking AP Art 3D, a subject that has titillated different senses and parts of my brain. I am often categorized as a left brain person for having excelled in STEM subjects but my curiosity for art has given me a different outlook in life. What fascinates me is learning the nuances of communicating my ideas through not only images but also through materials and processes. I understand now how everything is symbiotic, as in life. It is not just the words we speak but our actions and how it is presented. When I encounter a problem, I now take a more holistic approach which helps me be more creative in problem solving as I can see more angles outside the box.

> [!para]
> From the beginning of basic biology last year to halfway through AP Biology now, nothing fails to amaze me each chapter. Before I began learning biology at all, people would always tell me that biology would not be a good fit for me, coming from a math/logic mindset. They claim that biology is majority memorization and not much math, logic, or intuition at all. I decided to take biology anyway, just to explore and see if I would be interested in it. Now I find biology to not only be intuitive and interesting, but biology feels like the crossroads of all my favorite subjects. I love trying to understand the why of things and biology give me a lot of answers to those questions.

> [!para]
> I am excited to be able to take part of the AP Literature and Composition class this year. Although I may be much stronger in other subjects compared to English, I enjoy being pushed and working hard toward things in me that require improvement, and Literature is one of those things for me. I also look forward to be learning in Forensic Science. I have never took a class like that before and am unsure of how it'll be, but I am curious about how it will interact with other knowledge from other science classes, as I always find the crossroads of information to be the most interesting.

As I take on more responsibilities in life, whether it be my bagel company, interning at the art studio, still going to school, participating in a multitude of extracurriculars, or just finding time to hang out with friends, it takes more effort to be able to balances all responsibilities and still succeed at everything I want to accomplish. I realize that time is currently my greatest resource. Anything without enough effort can be accomplished with enough time, but choosing where I want to spend it is the biggest question plaguing me currently.

**Option A**  
Please respond to one of the following quotations in an essay of not more than 300 words. It is not necessary to research, read, or refer to the texts from which these quotations are taken; we are looking for original, personal responses to these short excerpts. Remember that your essay should be personal in nature and not simply an argumentative essay.  
  
1.    “Rigorous reasoning is crucial in mathematics, and insight plays an important secondary role these days. In the natural sciences, I would say that the order of these two virtues is reversed. Rigor is, of course, very important. But the most important value is insight—insight into the workings of the world. It may be because there is another guarantor of correctness in the sciences, namely, the empirical evidence from observation and experiments.”  
_Kannan Jagannathan, Professor of Physics, Amherst College_  
  
2.    “Translation is the art of bridging cultures. It’s about interpreting the essence of a text, transporting its rhythms and becoming intimate with its meaning…Translation, however, doesn’t only occur across languages: mentally putting any idea into words is an act of translation; so is composing a symphony, doing business in the global market, understanding the roots of terrorism. No citizen, especially today, can exist in isolation – that is, untranslated.”  
_Ilan Stavans, Professor of Latin American and Latino Culture, Amherst College, Robert Croll ’16 and Cedric Duquene ’15, adapted from the original print version of “Interpreting Terras Irradient,” Amherst Magazine, Spring 2015._  
  
3.    “Creating an environment that allows students to build lasting friendships, including those that cut across seemingly entrenched societal and political boundaries…requires candor about the inevitable tensions, as well as about the wonderful opportunities, that diversity and inclusiveness create.”   
_Carolyn "Biddy" Martin, 19th President of Amherst College, from Letter to Amherst College Alumni and Families, December 28, 2015._   
  
4.    “Difficulty need not foreshadow despair or defeat. Rather achievement can be all the more satisfying because of obstacles surmounted.”  
_Attributed to William Hastie, Amherst Class of 1925, the first African-American to serve as a judge for the United States Court of Appeal._  
  
**Option B**  
Please submit a graded paper from your junior or senior year that best represents your writing skills and analytical abilities. We are particularly interested in your ability to construct a tightly reasoned, persuasive argument that calls upon literary, sociological or historical evidence. You should NOT submit a laboratory report, journal entry, creative writing sample or in-class essay.  
  
**Option C**  
If you were an applicant to Amherst's Diversity Open House (A2A) weekend program, you may use your A2A application essay in satisfaction of our Supplemental Writing requirement. If you would like to do so, please select Option C; we will then transfer your previously received A2A essay to your Regular Decision application file.
