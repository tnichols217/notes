To be at home in all lands and all ages;
to count Nature a familiar acquaintance,
and Art an intimate friend;
To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work
And the criticism of your own;
to carry the keys of the world's library in your pocket,
and feel its resources behind you in whatever task you undertake;
to make hosts of friends...who are to be leaders in all walks of life;
to lose yourself in generous enthusiasms and cooperate with others for common ends –
this is the offer of the college for the best four years of your life.

1. Which line from the Offer resonates most with you? (250 words)

To gain a standard for the appreciation of others' work and the criticism of your own;

## 🟩

> [!para]
> Being able to appreciate other people's work stuck out to me in particular because of the implication of thoughtfulness, respect, and community. These ideas are only solidified by the end of the line: "and the criticism of your own". Although the rest of the piece alludes to similar ideas: being home, art and nature being friends, making friends, and cooperation, the expression of these ideals were not expressed as elegantly nor subtly as in this line. Although community is highly valued by me, respect in this community is arguably equally as important, which is not as strongly expressed in any other line of this poem. Being from Asian culture, respect is very well defined and understood by everyone. A community without respect means nothing. Not being able to understand and appreciate each other practically removes all aspects of a healthy community, and this line expresses that concisely among the descriptions of community in other lines. Lastly, I resonate with the idea of thoughtfulness and time well spent. Very often in the modern world do we forget to take a step back and spend time thinking, processing, and appreciating other people's ideas and works. I came to the important realization that thoughtful works demand thoughtful appreciation while walking through art galleries, looking at artwork that was very unfamiliar to me. This line well expresses the need for thoughtfulness and appreciation, as well as criticism, of works.

> Born to an American father and Malaysian mother, I have grown up understanding and balancing different cultures. My parents teach in a non-profit American international school in Malaysia where I am privileged to attend along with peers from over twenty five nations. On a broader scope, I live in a multicultural country that is made up of three predominant ethnicities. Living in this environment, I learned that unity and harmony exist from understanding and not tolerance. Tolerance suggests enduring or "putting up with" while understanding implies that there is nothing to “endure”, and that existing in harmony within a community of different beliefs and practices is one out of respect and acceptance. Once, my school rolled out a personality test that groups personalities by colors. That made me understand why some “blue” teachers can spend a whole block talking about feelings when something tragic happened, and why my “green” principle can come off as serious and goal oriented. It doesn’t mean that the “blue” teacher is not focused on academics, or the “green” principle is uncaring, they just have different personalities. I see culture the same way, if I understand the “personalities” of culture, acceptance of each other’s beliefs and practices becomes natural.

- Before graduation, every Carleton student completes a senior project, known as “comps.” [Comps projects](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/explore/education/comps/) take many different forms: a few recent examples are formal research papers, public presentations, and even a live staging of a theater production. Based on your current academic interests, what type of comps project or topic would you explore, and why? (No pressure, we won’t hold you to this!)  

- [Traditions at Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/admissions/explore/outside-class/traditions/) center around building and appreciating community. Some examples include the new student frisbee toss, Friday flowers, and baking cookies at Dacie Moses House. If you were tasked with creating a new Carleton tradition, what would you propose and how would you emphasize community within your idea?*

> I want to make computing transparent and portable again. Lately there have been so much de-standardization in the computing sector, where products that fulfill the same purpose are completely incompatible with each other, capturing and locking in the customers. Although this is good from a business point of view, it is a highly anti-consumerist principle. I envision a world where interconnect-ability is a given and not a feature. I would work not only towards setting and maintaining standards, but also by innovating in its respective field by showing the true benefits of modular design. People often believe that standards are a box to fit into and would hurt creativity and stifle innovation, but standards truly just set a baseline from where you should improve and innovate. So much that we take for granted in the modern age is provided by modular design. When I was designing my own operating system from the kernel up, I was amazed at how many options for everything there were: the kernel itself, shell interpreters, desktop environments, display managers, drivers, and just the configuration and styling of everything. As a programmer, looking inside and trying to change things and modify things to my liking is proven to be much simpler when modular in nature. I wish that all reasonable things would be able to follow a similar philosophy: ultimately, stylistic and operational choice should be up to the user/consumer, and modules provide just the interface to provide that.

> [!para]
> I love the interaction of modular systems. Learning how completely different things can interface and function in unison always seemed so surprising so me. Particularly in the computer science / computer engineering area, over the past few years this process has been steadily demystifying itself to me yet it still remains interesting and intriguing. Although modular design has its own benefits and drawbacks, I find how modules may be interchanged as long as it fits the form and function beneficial not only for maintainability but also in a sense of freedom. Freedom to choose and build your own system with modules of your choice. I find Haverford's honor code to provide the same freedom. Although unintuitive that a set of rules may provide freedom, this document (not just a set of rules) demystifies the purpose of everything, when it is simply created by the students themselves. Haverford's honor code would provide a safe and beneficial system of which would push new innovations and creations without the worry of doing it wrong.

> [!para]
> This year I am taking AP Art 3D, a subject that has titillated different senses and parts of my brain. I am often categorized as a left brain person for having excelled in STEM subjects but my curiosity for art has given me a different outlook in life. What fascinates me is learning the nuances of communicating my ideas through not only images but also through materials and processes. I understand now how everything is symbiotic, as in life. It is not just the words we speak but our actions and how it is presented. When I encounter a problem, I now take a more holistic approach which helps me be more creative in problem solving as I can see more angles outside the box.

> [!para]
> From the beginning of basic biology last year to halfway through AP Biology now, nothing fails to amaze me each chapter. Before I began learning biology at all, people would always tell me that biology would not be a good fit for me, coming from a math/logic mindset. They claim that biology is majority memorization and not much math, logic, or intuition at all. I decided to take biology anyway, just to explore and see if I would be interested in it. Now I find biology to not only be intuitive and interesting, but biology feels like the crossroads of all my favorite subjects. I love trying to understand the why of things and biology give me a lot of answers to those questions.

> I am excited to be able to take part of the AP Literature and Composition class this year. Although I may be much stronger in other subjects compared to English, I enjoy being pushed and working hard toward things in me that require improvement, and Literature is one of those things for me. I also look forward to be learning in Forensic Science. I have never took a class like that before and am unsure of how it'll be, but I am curious about how it will interact with other knowledge from other science classes, as I always find the crossroads of information to be the most interesting.

Mika explained that he was creating testers for a rail attached spring launcher as a teaching aide for the physics class. He began explaining the specifics - without the basics at all - of how 3d models get sliced, turning them into g-code, sent to his 3D printer wirelessly, printed, and the other 300 steps in between. I was completely stunned. I was also still deeply intrigued. My measly experience with the windows batch scripting language now felt minute compared to what was possible. This first exposure got me into computers in general. It led me down to learn - rather surprisingly - JavaScript as my first "real" programming language, as well as gaining much experience in how 3D design and CAD works. From there my interest only grew. This led me to develop passions for web development and computer aided 3D design (CAD), which eventually developed into passions for programming in general and 3D design and animation. My newfound passion in programming propelled me to learn over eleven languages for various reasons. I find the art of problem solving a beautiful puzzle and part of enjoying programming is how different languages offer different paths to accomplish similar goals. There never ceases for there to be problems to solve, solutions to improve, and ideas to create when it comes to programming.

I believe that providing resources to explore and a good community are the most important aspects. Without a community, understanding how to collaborate and work in teams would be an impossibility. Additionally, my exploration of interests will be severely harmed by not having good people to share and explore with and building a network of people with similar interests could not be done without the great community found at Carnegie Mellon. Providing resources to explore a field is also key for providing a valuable college experience, not only showing the facts but also the capability to wander and push the field forward. This combination of ideas would lead to in my eyes a successful and enjoyable college experience.

Even though my current High School lacks solid computer science courses or resources, I spent a lot time self studying and learning on my own, finding resources and dedicating time and effort into learning it well. My school did not offer AP Computer Science at all until this (my senior) year. After registering for the course and attending a few lessons, the teacher told me that she has nothing more to teach me in this class, and that it would be boring and ineffective for me to sit in the class. She recommended I not waste my time in this class and spend time continuing my self studies. This led me to getting an internship in the tech department (a first for my school), where I apply my skills and learn where I need to improve and sharpen any particular aspect of the discipline.

> From the day I first discovered CAD to now, I have always been dedicated to improving my 3D design skills. From my first few creations of puzzles and brain games to functional devices to then creating art, I remained interested and curious about the possibilities of what could be done. When I entered AP 3D Art I pushed my 3D design further and explored materials, form, space, composition, value, and methods of creation. This dedication to the refining of my skills eventually landed me an internship at a local art studio just over a month ago, where I learned to work on a team - collaborating, planning, and working together. It also allowed me to share and learn more about the creation of art with equally passionate people.

I find the art of problem solving a beautiful puzzle and part of enjoying programming is how different languages offer different paths to accomplish similar goals. There never ceases for there to be problems to solve, solutions to improve, and ideas to create when it comes to programming.
> 
> Computer Science always managed to puzzle me a different way. I love puzzles; not the physical kind, but the mental kind. For me there is always a certain satisfaction that is to be had following the solution to any problem. Given any one problem in computer science, when broken down into individual pieces, each minute solution provides a rush and motivation to reach for the next problem, and before you realize that you've solved hundreds of pieces, the overarching problem is complete. These puzzles are never the same and almost always require learning something new, forcing me to expand my knowledge - which I enjoy very much. I believe part of solving such different puzzles leads to getting a general intuition for how to learn something: not just the act of learning something, but learning the way to learn more effectively. As I love exploring as well, computer science is the perfect match for me.
> 
> Another aspect that I love is the community surrounding Computer Science. Almost all programmers want to help and collaborative solve problems together, which led to amazing creations through open source code. I first entered this whole ecosystem as a user, using open source software and wondering what made it different. When I understood that open source code is often contributed to by many people around the world often without any gain other than a better piece of software, I was amazed. How could so many people unite to create something with code through such a system? I use a note-taking software called Obsidian, which has support for plugins (or extensions) to improve on the note-taking experience. I was using a plugin called Obsidian git, which allows me to sync my notes to the internet and across devices when I noticed that it did not sync specific folders correctly. This was when I realized how easy it was to join the developer community and help create this plugin for everyone. I visited the issue tracker and submitted an issue, to which a developer quickly responded with an analysis of the situation. A couple days later I had the code modified to fix the bug and submitted back to the project. It felt good to be able to contribute on a project with other people, even if I don't know them. The community was so open to suggestions and modifications that it inspired me to create a plugin of my own - obsidian columns. This time again I was surprised at how helpful the community is, reporting issues with my code, offering possible solutions, and even writing code for the plugin. I love taking part of the community and being able to share back, and contributing to open source code is one of those ways.

> I have been volunteering and teaching in Rohingyan schools for the past year. Once a week I would travel off the island that I live on, onto the mainland and visit a few schools, where I would teach English, Math, Science, and some basic crafts like macrame and sewing. Although it may seem like I am impacting such a small amount of people by only targeting three schools/centers on the mainland, it felt as if I really made a difference in these people's lives. Being documented refugees by UNICEF but unrecognized by the government, they have no legal methods to work, money comes by hard and education comes harder. After a couple weeks, I began to bring friends and family to come along with me. Whenever we would arrive, the children would be so happy and excited to be able to learn and spend time with us. In a way they have impacted me and my friends and family as well, showing us that even with so little it doesn't take away from our ability to be satisfied and happy.

> Born to an American father and Malaysian mother, I have grown up understanding and balancing different cultures. My parents teach in a non-profit American international school in Malaysia where I am privileged to attend along with peers from over twenty five nations. On a broader scope, I live in a multicultural country that is made up of three predominant ethnicities. Living in this environment, I learned that unity and harmony exist from understanding each other's culture and not tolerance. Tolerance suggests enduring or "putting up with" while understanding implies that there is nothing to “endure” but instead taking the time and effort to study and putting myself in their shoes, and that existing in harmony within a community of different beliefs and practices is one out of respect and acceptance. Once, my school rolled out a personality test that groups personalities by colors. That made me understand why some “blue” teachers can spend a whole block talking about our feelings when something tragic happened, and why my “green” principle can come off as serious and goal oriented. It doesn’t mean that the “blue” teacher is not focused on academics, or the “green” principle is uncaring, they just have different personalities. I see culture the same way, if I understand the “personalities” of culture, acceptance of each other’s beliefs and practices becomes natural.

**Option A**
Please respond to one of the following quotations in an essay of not more than 300 words. It is not necessary to research, read, or refer to the texts from which these quotations are taken; we are looking for original, personal responses to these short excerpts. Remember that your essay should be personal in nature and not simply an argumentative essay.  
  
1.    “Rigorous reasoning is crucial in mathematics, and insight plays an important secondary role these days. In the natural sciences, I would say that the order of these two virtues is reversed. Rigor is, of course, very important. But the most important value is insight—insight into the workings of the world. It may be because there is another guarantor of correctness in the sciences, namely, the empirical evidence from observation and experiments.”  
_Kannan Jagannathan, Professor of Physics, Amherst College_  
  
2.    “Translation is the art of bridging cultures. It’s about interpreting the essence of a text, transporting its rhythms and becoming intimate with its meaning…Translation, however, doesn’t only occur across languages: mentally putting any idea into words is an act of translation; so is composing a symphony, doing business in the global market, understanding the roots of terrorism. No citizen, especially today, can exist in isolation – that is, untranslated.”  
_Ilan Stavans, Professor of Latin American and Latino Culture, Amherst College, Robert Croll ’16 and Cedric Duquene ’15, adapted from the original print version of “Interpreting Terras Irradient,” Amherst Magazine, Spring 2015._  
  
3.    “Creating an environment that allows students to build lasting friendships, including those that cut across seemingly entrenched societal and political boundaries…requires candor about the inevitable tensions, as well as about the wonderful opportunities, that diversity and inclusiveness create.”   
_Carolyn "Biddy" Martin, 19th President of Amherst College, from Letter to Amherst College Alumni and Families, December 28, 2015._   
  
4.    “Difficulty need not foreshadow despair or defeat. Rather achievement can be all the more satisfying because of obstacles surmounted.”  
_Attributed to William Hastie, Amherst Class of 1925, the first African-American to serve as a judge for the United States Court of Appeal._  
  
**Option B**  
Please submit a graded paper from your junior or senior year that best represents your writing skills and analytical abilities. We are particularly interested in your ability to construct a tightly reasoned, persuasive argument that calls upon literary, sociological or historical evidence. You should NOT submit a laboratory report, journal entry, creative writing sample or in-class essay.

> My computer science teacher told us on the very first day on AP Computer Science that "Data without insight is meaningless." I could not agree more. Just like the problem with AI training models these days, there is plenty of data, but there is not much meaningful (meaning labeled data) available. Similarly, rigorous reasoning without a direction to focus towards would be meaningless. In my life there have been several times when I was dedicated to completing something, but I was dedicated to the wrong cause. Effort without direction is meaningless. Back when I was much younger I made the most coveted soccer team. It was my greatest achievement ever, I thought back then. I was so proud that I made the team that I would train vigorously multiple times a week, without ever assessing why I invested the time into refining and strengthening my skills in soccer. I learned a lot through this experience not only in skills and teamwork but the intention of playing soccer was not because of my love for soccer, but more so to be in a prestigious team. Naturally, my interest and dedication to train dwindled as the novelty of being part of the team wore off. Had soccer been my love and passion, this would not have happened. 
> 
> Dedication on its own has no point unless you are being dedicated towards a cause you want to achieve. It may seem obvious that you would only ever be dedicated towards things you are sure you would continue to love and enjoy, but without proper assessment and thought it could lead to an unsustainable effort. Getting onto the soccer team blinded me from thinking if this is really what I wanted to achieve, leading me to reverse the two virtues of cause then dedication.

> Always wanting to be part of something greater and exciting, USC offers just that in an inclusive manner. Moving away from a country I've always lived in, USC would offer me the support and community I need to feel right at home, even if I just moved as far as I possibly could from home. My excited and energetic nature would fit right in at USC, taking part and contributing to the powerful school spirit already present at USC. Additionally, USC would provide everything I could want or need in order to learn and research Computer Science, something that not many colleges could provide as easily.

> Securing Cyberspace is the most important to me. It is evident that in the current state of the world, not many people are educated on the security and privacy in the digital space. Cyberspace in general already has multiple solutions for all the security problems we have today, yet we still encounter these problems due to lazy implementations or simply lack of resources to allocate towards such protections. Several years ago I was of the belief that free services with ads were good; not because of the ads, but because the ads enabled access to great services without cost. Although true that the ads enabled such services, I now see that although there is no monetary cost of such services, the informational cost is exponentially higher. Many free online services would collect data, essentially learning exactly who you are in a sense, in order to target particular audiences or just sell personal information. I believe that providing free, or cheap, alternatives to such services is also equally as important than programatically securing services - essentially securing users' identities. Additionally, digital security should be of lower cost both computationally and in effort - being both more applicable to even lower power devices and also on by default. More importantly, there should be more accessible standards for security. There already are standards for protocols and and APIs, but normally security standards are not linked to such protocols and instead should be defaults instead of an additional configuration.

1. Why do you want to attend Claremont McKenna College? (250 words)

## 🟨

2. One of the hallmarks of a CMC education is the first-year humanities program that all students take in their first year at the College. The program has two components: the Freshman Humanities Seminar (FHS) and the Freshman Writing Seminar (FWS). While each FHS and FWS seminar has a distinctive approach in terms of texts and topics, their pairing gives first-year students a shared academic experience in small, writing-intensive courses that foster critical thinking about a wide range of important issues. 
   FHS introduces first-year students to some of the crucial questions that human beings face with relation to society and the world. Individual sections are taught by faculty from a range of departments. Past and current topics include:
	1.  Democracy and Leadership
	2.  Women in Science
	3.  Unconventional Thinking 
   FWS, taught by faculty from the literature department, develops students’ abilities in written and oral communication at the college level. Past and current topics include:
	1.  Art of the Personal Essay
	2.  Race, Gender, and Hollywood Film
	3.  Post-Apocalyptic Humanity
   For the purpose of this essay prompt, pick one FHS or FWS seminar to study at CMC. What part of your personal experience—or your desire to know more about an area outside of your experience—best explains your seminar choice? (250 words)
