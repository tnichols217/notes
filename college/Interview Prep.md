> [!para]
> I love the intersection between technology and art, how I can interact with and help the community on any scale, and also just rock climbing or running.
> 
> I find the combinations of tech and art really interesting as they appear to be such polar opposite fields, but as I studied both I find that there really is a lot in common. For example, when I first started learning perspective drawing, I was wondering why for two and three point perspective some people's drawings were looking distorted even if they put their points far apart. Later that day I went home and calculated and simulated why such things happened, and I learned about tilt-shift photography at the same time, which happens to be what this particular distortion effect is called when applied to photography although through completely different means. Further down the road, I began teaching myself how to do basic 3-D modeling with blender, which is where I began learning about procedural design, which is one of my favorite things about 3-D art to this day. Using math and computers with procedurally generated shapes and texture to express myself through the production of art blew my mind of how two of my favorite hobbies could be combined.
> 
> Secondly, I love the communities around me, whether it be Penang Island as a whole, or just my rock climbing acquaintances. On my multiple trips to go serve around and beyond Penang, I learned that community is important and helping out wherever I can is equally as important. Lately I've been volunteering to teach at a refugee school for the Rohingya and being able to interact with their community, although different, was greatly enjoyable, but also impactful for them and for me. 
> 
> Lastly, I love running and rock climbing. I've been running for nearly 3 years now and have done both long and short distance. Although I don't consider myself particularly experienced, I still enjoy running both for sport and for fun. And, I took up rock climbing roughly four years ago, initially as a joke, but have since then grown to love it as well. I find the community around rock climbing terrifically positive, whenever you'd go climbing you'll always get encouragement and applause from complete strangers, and I feel like this has led me to getting to know a lot of people over the years.
> 
> Although I heavily enjoy all these things, I feel like my sense of community is the most important of them all. Being able to do and see amazing things is just multiple times more enjoyable when shared with someone.
