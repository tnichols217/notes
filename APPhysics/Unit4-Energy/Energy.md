# Energy
- Unit of measurement: Joules (J)
	- "currency of the universe"
	- ### $J=\frac{kg*m^2}{s^2}$

### $K = \frac{mv^2}{2}$
- Kinetic Energy
- m is mass
- v is velocity
### $U_G = mgh$
- m is mass
- g is graitational constant
- h is height from 
%%### $U_G = $%%
### $U_S = \frac{kx^2}{2}$
- #### $|\overrightarrow{F_s}| = k|\overrightarrow{x}|$
	- Hooke's law for reference
- k is the spring constant (strength of spring)
- x is the extension or compression of the spring (in m)

## Types of energy
- Kinetic
	- Translational
		- Movement
	- Rotational
		- Rotating
- Potential (U)
	- Electrical
	- Chemical
	- Gravitational ($U_G$)
	- Elastic ($U_S$)
	- Nuclear
- Mechanical
	- Kinetic + Potential
	- Just the sum
