## $|\overrightarrow{F_s}|=k\overrightarrow{x}$
### Extension
- The extension of a string is directly linearly related to the force on the string
- The higher the spring constant, the more stiff the string is
- Once the spring reaches its limit, it would begin to experience plastic deformation, where the spring would not follow Hooke's Law
### Compression
- The spring constant is the same for compression and extension
