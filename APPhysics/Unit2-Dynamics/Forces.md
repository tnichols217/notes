# Forces
## Force of gravity
- Weight is **not** mass
- Mass is a measure of how much matter an object has
	- Mass is **constant** no matter where you are and what circumstances you are in
- Weight is the **force of gravity** acting on a mass
- **Mass** is measured in **kg**
- **Weight** is measured in **N**

## Normal Force
- Normal force is always **perpendicular** to a surface that the object is touching
- If there are several forces acting on an object, the Normal force **must** be perpendicular to the surface, so you must separate your vector

## Tension Force
- Can only **pull** on an object

## Friction Forces
- The amount of friction is **linearly related** to the amount of **normal force** on an object
- If a friction coeffecient is above 1, the surface is considered "sticky"
### Static Friction
- Static friction is in effect when an object is **still** in comparison to a surface it is touching
- The amount of friction is measured in **N** however, the way we measure the amount of friction two surfaces will have is a unitless measurement
	- The static fricion coeffecient is represented by the variable **$\mu_s$**
	- Formula for calculating the coeffecient is $F_{f_s} = \mu_s*F_N$
- Static friction will have a **maximum** value, but it will be smaller if there is no force against it
### Kinetic Friction
- Kinetic friction is in effect when an object is sliding against a surface
- Friction force is measured in **N**, but kinetic friction has its own friction coeffecient
	- The kinetic fricion coeffecient is represented by the variable **$\mu_k$**
	- Formula for calculating the coeffecient is $F_{f_k} = \mu_k*F_N$
- Static Friction and Kinetic Friction can have **different** coeffecients, often with the static friction being more
