# Newton's Laws
## First Law
### Things will stay in motion or stay at rest unless there is an external force acting on it
When the net force on an object is non-zero, the object will be experience an acceleration
> **$\Sigma F \ne 0$** => **$a \ne 0$**

An object will have constant velocity or zero velocity when the net force is 0.
> **$\Sigma F = 0$** => Velocity is constant or 0

A non-zero net force is also known as an unbalanced force
A zero net force is also known as a balanced force.

#### Systems of objects
When dealing with systems of objects, internal forces do not matter

When the net force on the system is non-zero, the system's center of mass will experience an acceleration
> **$\Sigma F \ne 0$** => **$a \ne 0$**

The system's center of mass will have constant velocity or zero velocity when the net force is 0.
> **$\Sigma F = 0$** => Velocity is constant or 0

## Newton's Second Law
### The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force on it
#### $\Sigma F=ma$
- The sum of all forces (net force) is proportional to the acceleration of the object by its mass.
- The mass, force, and acceleration are all related directly.
- If there is any net force at all, then there is acceleration

The direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force
- The forces can be broken down into separate vectors

## Newton's Third Law
### Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
#### $F_{AB} = -F_{BA}$
- If Object A is exerting a force on object B, B is exerting an equal and opposite force back on object A
- True regardless of mass or acceleration
-
