# Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Everything has a pull on each other
- For example, the Earth has a pull on the moon and gravity acts as a centripetal acceleration on the moon.
- Gravity is always attractive, never repulsive

## $|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$
## $G=6.67 * 10^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg*s^2}$
- $G$ is the universal gravitational constant
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects
- $m_1$ is the mass of the first object
- $m_2$ is the mass of the second object

## Acceleration due to gravity
Can easily be found using the formula
### $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$

## Examples
For example: The Earth and the moon
- $G$ remains constant
- $r$ is 384,400,000 m
- $m_1$ (earth) is 5.972 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg
- $m_2$ (moon) is 7.348 × 10<sup>22</sup> kg
- $|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=1.982*10^{20}N$

Example 2: What is the speed of the moon around earth?

Sincle the moon travels in a roughly circular orbit around earth, we can use the centripetal acceleration formula 
$$
\begin{gathered}
|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=m_{moon}a_c\\\\
|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=G\frac{m_{earth}m_{moon}}{r^2}\\\\
a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}\\\\
G\frac{m_{earth}m_{moon}}{r^2}=m_{moon}\frac{v^2}{r}\\\\
G\frac{m_{earth}}{r}=v^2\\\\
v=\sqrt{G\frac{m_{earth}}{r}}\\\\
v=\sqrt{6.67 * 10^{-11}\frac{5.972 * 10^{24}}{384400000}}\\\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 3: Calculate the mass of the earth from its g and radius
$$
\begin{gathered}
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}\\\\
10 = \frac{GM}{6371000^2}\\\\
M = \frac{6371000^2*10}{G}\\\\
M = 5.96*10^{24}
\end{gathered}
$$
