Two blocks, with given masses $m_1 = 14.29 kg$ and $m_2 = 3.67 kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. The blocks sit side-by-side in contact with each other. A given applied external horizontal force $F_{app} = 16.84 N$ is applied to the side of the first block of mass $m_$1$ which
in turn pushes against the second block of mass m2 . As a result, both blocks are accelerated.
