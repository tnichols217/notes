Two blocks, with given masses $m_1 = 14.29 kg$ and $m_2 = 3.67 kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. The blocks sit side-by-side in contact with each other. A given applied external horizontal force $F_{app} = 16.84 N$ is applied to the side of the first block of mass $m_1$ which in turn pushes against the second block of mass $m_2$ . As a result, both blocks are accelerated.

## a

Draw a little sketch that indicates what is going on here. We need to see the two blocks in your sketch. We need to see how they are positioned relative to each other. We also need to see any coordinate system you plan to use. Also write down a list of *given parameters* for this problem (there are three of these). Also draw **Free Body Diagrams** for each of the two blocks indicating *all* of the relevant forces on each block. Be sure your forces are properly labeled: Use the “On-due” system. For example, one of your forces should be labeled like this: $\vec N_{21}$ which means “the Normal force *on* Block 2 *due* to Block 1.

What is the acceleration for the two blocks that results? You can safely assume that the two blocks move together (Yes, yes you can. This is called a *Kinematic Constraint*.) Explain your work.

Two blocks are placed together on a table as shown. Block A has a given mass $m_A$ and Block B has a given mass $m_B$. There is **friction** acting on the surfaces between the two blocks. However, the surface of the table is **frictionless**. An instructor pushes horizontally on Block B with his finger with a constant given (known) applied force $F_{app}$ . Assume also that **known** values of both the coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$ and the coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$ are given parameters. Finally, here we observe that the given applied force $F_{app}$ is small enough so that Block A **neither slips nor slides** relative to Block B. (In other words, Block A stays stuck to Block B).

## a

Draw two Free Body Diagrams (FBDs), one for each block, showing *all* vertical and horizontal forces on each. Make sure that your diagrams clearly indicate the nature (type) and direction of each force. Make sure that your forces are labeled with appropriate subscripts, as needed. (For example, $\vec W_A$ means the Weight Force on Block A. $\vec N_{AB}$ means the Normal Force on Block A due to Block B.)

## b

 Calculate **all** of the forces on each of the two blocks. Also calculate the accelerations, $a_A$ and $a_B$ for each of the two blocks. Express your answers in terms of the given parameters. Show your work.

“**The Rotor Ride**: Perhaps the most feared ride at the amusement park is this small, seemingly non-intimidating attraction. It consists of a small barrel that spins in a circle about a vertical axis. Riders enter the ride and then stand with their backs against the inside wall of the barrel. As the barrel spins faster and faster, the centripetally inward force of the wall against the riders’ backs becomes greater and greater. All of a sudden, the floor is dropped out from under the riders. It is the friction between the barrel wall and the riders that keep the riders from falling. The rotor ride is a great place to learn the thrill of centripetal acceleration.”

## a

Consider the forces on a single rider as shown on the right-most figure above. Draw a careful and complete Free-Body-Diagram to indicate all of the forces on the rider. Be sure to indicate a proper coordinate system.

## b

Assume that after the floor falls out, the rider is moving around inside the ride at a given constant speed $V$. Assume that the rider has a given mass $M$ , and that the barrel of the rotor has a given radius $R$. Also assume that the coefficient of static friction between the rider and the wall is given as $\mu$. Calculate the magnitude and direction of every force on the rider who is stuck to the wall after the floor falls away. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain
your work.

A motorcyclist performs a somewhat nauseating trick by driving on a vertical circular track (so-called “loop-the-loop”). The position of the motorcyclist is show at four positions (A, B, C, D) corresponding to bottom, right, top and left points on the track respectively. The mass of the motorcyclist and his motorcycle together is given as $m$. The radius of the circular path is given as $R$.

## a

Assume that the motorcyclist somehow maintains *constant speed* $V$ . Draw a careful Free Body Diagram showing all of the forces on system that is the motorcyclist and his motorcycle together when he is in **Position C**. Calculate the magnitude and direction of each force.

## b

Assume that the motorcyclist maintains *constant speed* $V$ . Draw a careful Free Body Diagram showing all of the forces on system that is the motorcyclist and his motorcycle together when he is in **Position D**. Calculate the magnitude and direction of each force on your FBD.

Block A with a given mass $m_A$ is positioned on top of Block B with a given mass $m_b$. The coefficient of kinetic (sliding) friction between Block A and Block B is given as $\mu_k$ . Block B sits on a frictionless surface. Block A is tied to the wall with an ideal string which prevents Block A from moving to the right. A given constant horizontal tension force $T_{app}$ is applied to Block B as shown, with the result that Block B slides to the right.

## a

Carefully draw a neat “Free Body Diagram” (FBD) for each of the two blocks. Be sure to indicate and properly label all forces that are applied to each block.

## b

If you have drawn your two FBDs correctly, there will be two “Third Law Forces Pairs.” Which four forces correspond to these two pairs? Explain how you know this.

## c

Determine $T_1$ , the tension in the rope that is attached to Block A in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work. Hint: the rope does more that simply provide a force of tension on Block A. The rope also imposes a *kinematic constraint* on the acceleration of Block A.

## d

Determine $a_x$ , the acceleration of Block B in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.
