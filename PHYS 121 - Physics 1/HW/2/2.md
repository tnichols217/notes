Two blocks, with given masses $m_1 = 14.29 kg$ and $m_2 = 3.67 kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. The blocks sit side-by-side in contact with each other. A given applied external horizontal force $F_{app} = 16.84 N$ is applied to the side of the first block of mass $m_$1$ which in turn pushes against the second block of mass $m_2$ . As a result, both blocks are accelerated.

## a

Draw a little sketch that indicates what is going on here. We need to see the two blocks in your sketch. We need to see how they are positioned relative to each other. We also need to see any coordinate system you plan to use. Also write down a list of *given parameters* for this problem (there are three of these). Also draw **Free Body Diagrams** for each of the two blocks indicating *all* of the relevant forces on each block. Be sure your forces are properly labeled: Use the “On-due” system. For example, one of your forces should be labeled like this: $\vec N_{21}$ which means “the Normal force *on* Block 2 *due* to Block 1.

## b

What is the acceleration for the two blocks that results? You can safely assume that the two blocks move together (Yes, yes you can. This is called a *Kinematic Constraint*.) Explain your work.

## c

What is the magnitude of the Normal force exerted on Block 1 due to Block 2? Explain your work.

Two blocks are placed together on a table as shown. Block A has a given mass $m_A$ and Block B has a given mass $m_B$. There is **friction** acting on the surfaces between the two blocks. However, the surface of the table is **frictionless**. An instructor pushes horizontally on Block B with his finger with a constant given (known) applied force $F_{app}$ . Assume also that **known** values of both the coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$ and the coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$ are given parameters. Finally, here we observe that the given applied force $F_{app}$ is small enough so that Block A **neither slips nor slides** relative to Block B. (In other words, Block A stays stuck to Block B).

## a

Draw two Free Body Diagrams (FBDs), one for each block, showing *all* vertical and horizontal forces on each. Make sure that your diagrams clearly indicate the nature (type) and direction of each force. Make sure that your forces are labeled with appropriate subscripts, as needed. (For example, $\vec W_A$ means the Weight Force on Block A. $\vec N_{AB}$ means the Normal Force on Block A due to Block B.)

## b

 Calculate **all** of the forces on each of the two blocks. Also calculate the accelerations, $a_A$ and $a_B$ for each of the two blocks. Express your answers in terms of the given parameters. Show your work.
