Two blocks, with given masses $m_1 = 14.29 kg$ and $m_2 = 3.67 kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. The blocks sit side-by-side in contact with each other. A given applied external horizontal force $F_{app} = 16.84 N$ is applied to the side of the first block of mass $m_$1$ which in turn pushes against the second block of mass $m_2$ . As a result, both blocks are accelerated.

Draw a little sketch that indicates what is going on here. We need to see the two blocks in your sketch. We need to see how they are positioned relative to each other. We also need to see any coordinate system you plan to use. Also write down a list of given parameters for this problem (there are three of these). Also draw Free Body Diagrams for each of the two blocks indicating all of the relevant forces on each block. Be sure your forces are properly labeled: Use the “On-due” system. For example, one of your forces should be labeled like this: N ~ 21 which means “the Normal force on Block 2 due to Block 1.
