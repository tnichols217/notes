Two blocks, with given masses $m_1 = 14.29 kg$ and $m_2 = 3.67 kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. The blocks sit side-by-side in contact with each other. A given applied external horizontal force $F_{app} = 16.84 N$ is applied to the side of the first block of mass $m_1$ which in turn pushes against the second block of mass $m_2$ . As a result, both blocks are accelerated.

## a

Draw a little sketch that indicates what is going on here. We need to see the two blocks in your sketch. We need to see how they are positioned relative to each other. We also need to see any coordinate system you plan to use. Also write down a list of *given parameters* for this problem (there are three of these). Also draw **Free Body Diagrams** for each of the two blocks indicating *all* of the relevant forces on each block. Be sure your forces are properly labeled: Use the “On-due” system. For example, one of your forces should be labeled like this: $\vec N_{21}$ which means “the Normal force *on* Block 2 *due* to Block 1.

Two blocks are placed together on a table as shown. Block A has a given mass $m_A$ and Block B has a given mass $m_B$. There is **friction** acting on the surfaces between the two blocks. However, the surface of the table is **frictionless**. An instructor pushes horizontally on Block B with his finger with a constant given (known) applied force $F_{app}$ . Assume also that **known** values of both the coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$ and the coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$ are given parameters. Finally, here we observe that the given applied force $F_{app}$ is small enough so that Block A **neither slips nor slides** relative to Block B. (In other words, Block A stays stuck to Block B).

## a

Draw two Free Body Diagrams (FBDs), one for each block, showing *all* vertical and horizontal forces on each. Make sure that your diagrams clearly indicate the nature (type) and direction of each force. Make sure that your forces are labeled with appropriate subscripts, as needed. (For example, $\vec W_A$ means the Weight Force on Block A. $\vec N_{AB}$ means the Normal Force on Block A due to Block B.)

“**The Rotor Ride**: Perhaps the most feared ride at the amusement park is this small, seemingly non-intimidating attraction. It consists of a small barrel that spins in a circle about a vertical axis. Riders enter the ride and then stand with their backs against the inside wall of the barrel. As the barrel spins faster and faster, the centripetally inward force of the wall against the riders’ backs becomes greater and greater. All of a sudden, the floor is dropped out from under the riders. It is the friction between the barrel wall and the riders that keep the riders from falling. The rotor ride is a great place to learn the thrill of centripetal acceleration.”

## a

Consider the forces on a single rider as shown on the right-most figure above. Draw a careful and complete Free-Body-Diagram to indicate all of the forces on the rider. Be sure to indicate a proper coordinate system.

## b

Assume that after the floor falls out, the rider is moving around inside the ride at a given constant speed $V$. Assume that the rider has a given mass $M$ , and that the barrel of the rotor has a given radius $R$. Also assume that the coefficient of static friction between the rider and the wall is given as $\mu$. Calculate the magnitude and direction of every force on the rider who is stuck to the wall after the floor falls away. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

Block A with a given mass $m_a$ is positioned on top of Block B with a given mass $m_b$. The coefficient of kinetic (sliding) friction between Block A and Block B is given as $\mu_k$ . Block B sits on a frictionless surface. Block A is tied to the wall with an ideal string which prevents Block A from moving to the right. A given constant horizontal tension force $T_{app}$ is applied to Block B as shown, with the result that Block B slides to the right.
