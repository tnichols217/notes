A truck pulls a box up a ramp at a constant given constant acceleration $A$ as shown above with an ideal rope. The angle of the ramp is given as $\theta$. The wheels of the truck pull the truck up with no slipping and no sliding. The box is greased on the bottom surface so that there is a given coefficient of sliding friction between the box and the ramp of $\mu$. The mass of the truck is given as $m_t$ and the mass of the box is given as $m_b$.

## a

Draw a careful Free Body Diagram for both the truck and the box. Include a proper coordinate system and be sure to indicate every force on each body. Make very sure you have each force clearly and properly labeled. At this time we expect all students use the format and notation given in this class for every FBD.

The Simple Pendulum represents a rich system for checking our understanding of forces, work, and energy. This from a previous final exam:
A pendulum is made from a bob of mass $m$ and an ideal string of length $l$. Suppose the bob is pulled back and released from rest at a position with the string at an angle of $\theta_0$ relative to the vertical where $\theta_0$ has some particular but arbitrary value less than $90\degree$. For all of these questions give your answer in terms of the given parameters $m$, and $\theta_0$.

## c

Suppose a new planet is discovered at a great distance from the sun in deep space. The new planet is called Planet X. Suppose further that Planet X has moon, called Moon X, that orbits the planet in a circular orbit. Assume that the mass of the planet is quite large compared to the mass of the moon.

Suppose astronomers measure the radius of Planet X to be $R = 5.20\times105~ m$, and the orbital radius of Moon X to be $r = 4.61 \times 106~ m$, as shown. Suppose also that the orbital period of Moon X $P$ is measured to be $14.32~ h$. Assume that the mass of Planet X is known to be much larger than the mass of Moon X. In other words $M >> m$.

A block of given mass $m$ is released at rest at a position $y = 0$ where it is connected to an ideal spring with a given spring constant $k$. At the release, the spring is at its equilibrium position (neither compressed nor extended). Once released, the block falls vertically and the spring stretches.

## a

What is $y_{min}$ corresponding to the minimum position of the block after release?
Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work. Hint: Note that $y_{min}$ is negative.

> $y_{min}=-\frac{2mg}{k}$
> $\square$

## b

What is the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of the block when the block is at the position $y_{min}$ as calculated in Part (a)? Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work. Hint: no, the acceleration here is not zero.

> 
> $a=g$ Upwards
> $\square$

## c

What is $y_{max}$ , corresponding to the position of the block when it has maximum speed? Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work. Hint: You do not need to find the actual value of the maximum speed. Also Conservation of Energy is not what you want. Instead, think about the net force on the block as a function of position.

> [!answer]
> Since the motion of the block is sinusoidal as it is a reciprocating spring, velocity is also represented by a sinusoidal function, offset earlier by a quarter of the period.
> 
> The maximum velocity thus corresponds to time of the average location of the position sinusoidal function.
> 
> The average location of a sinusoidal can be found by the average of the max and min locations.

> $y_{avg}=\frac{y_{min}+y_{max}}{2}$
