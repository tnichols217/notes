A truck pulls a box up a ramp at a constant given constant acceleration $A$ as shown above with an ideal rope. The angle of the ramp is given as $\theta$. The wheels of the truck pull the truck up with no slipping and no sliding. The box is greased on the bottom surface so that there is a given coefficient of sliding friction between the box and the ramp of $\mu$. The mass of the truck is given as $m_t$ and the mass of the box is given as $m_b$.
