A truck pulls a box up a ramp at a constant given constant acceleration $A$ as shown above with an ideal rope. The angle of the ramp is given as $\theta$. The wheels of the truck pull the truck up with no slipping and no sliding. The box is greased on the bottom surface so that there is a given coefficient of sliding friction between the box and the ramp of $\mu$. The mass of the truck is given as $m_t$ and the mass of the box is given as $m_b$.

## a

Draw a careful Free Body Diagram for both the truck and the box. Include a proper coordinate system and be sure to indicate every force on each body. Make very sure you have each force clearly and properly labeled. At this time we expect all students use the format and notation given in this class for every FBD.

## b

In terms of given parameters $A$, $mt$ , $mb$ , $\mu$ and $\theta$, determine the magnitude of each and every force on both the truck and the box. Note: thee are four forces on each. Be sure you find all eight forces and express your answers in terms of the given parameters.

The Simple Pendulum represents a rich system for checking our understanding of forces, work, and energy. This from a previous final exam:
A pendulum is made from a bob of mass $m$ and an ideal string of length $l$. Suppose the bob is pulled back and released from rest at a position with the string at an angle of $\theta_0$ relative to the vertical where $\theta_0$ has some particular but arbitrary value less than $90\degree$. For all of these questions give your answer in terms of the given parameters $m$, and $\theta_0$.

## a

Draw a careful sketch of what is going on here.

## b

What is the magnitude of the acceleration of the bob immediately after the bob is released?
Hint: no it is not zero. Another hint. If you choose the right coordinate system this problem is relatively simple.

> $W_p=mg$

> There is only acceleration in the tangential direction $t$ as the string restrains it from moving in the centrifugal direction.
> There is also no centripetal acceleration as the initial velocity is $0$

> $a_p=\frac{mg\sin\theta_0}{m}$
> $a_p=g\sin\theta_0$
> 
> ---
> 
> $a_p=g\sin\theta_0$
> $\square$

## c

What is the tension on the string immediately after the bob is released? No, it is not zero. No, it is not $mg$.
Hint: What kind of acceleration applies in the direction of the string?

> [!answer]
> We can use force separation to separate the weight force into tangential and centrifugal. The centrifugal forces cancel as there is no acceleration in the centrifugal direction.

> $\square$

## d

What is the Work done by the force of Tension as the bob falls from its initial position to the position corresponding to the bottom of the arc?

> [!answer]
> Zero, as there is never any movement in the centrifugal direction, and the tension will always be in the centrifugal direction.

> $W=F\cdot d$
> $F\perp d$
> $W=0$

> ---
> $W=0$
> $\square$

## e

What is the Work done by the Weight force as the bob falls from its initial position to the position corresponding to the bottom of the arc?

> [!answer]
> $W=W_m\cdot d$
> $W=W_md_l$ Where $d_l$ is the distance traveled parallel to force $F$
> $d_l=l-l\cos\theta$ by geometric trig
> 
> $W=mg(l-l\cos\theta)$
> 
> ---
> 
> $W=mgl(1-\cos\theta)$
> $\square$

## f

What is the maximum speed $V$ of the bob during the swing of the pendulum?

> [!answer]
> The total energy in the system stays the same with an exception to work by an external force. In this case the only work is done by gravity.
> 
> We start at rest, so $W_i=0$
> $K_f=K_i+W$
> $K_f=W$
> $K_f=mgl(1-\cos\theta)$
> $K=mv^2$
> $v^2=gl(1-\cos\theta)$
> $v=\sqrt{gl(1-\cos\theta)}$
> 
> ---
> 
> $V=\sqrt{gl(1-\cos\theta)}$
> $\square$

## g

What is the magnitude of the force of Tension on the string when the bob is at the position corresponding to the bottom of the arc? Hint: No, $T = mg$ is not the correct answer.

> [!answer]
> $a_c=\frac{v^2}{l}$
> $a_c=g(1-\cos\theta)$
> $F_c=\frac{a_c}{m}$
> $F_c=T_m-W_m$
> $T_m=\frac{g(1-\cos\theta)}{m}+mg$
> 
> ---
> 
> $T_m=\frac{g(1-\cos\theta)}{m}+mg$
> $\square$

# 3

A “Conical Pendulum” is shown in the figure above. The bob of given mass $m$ travels in a horizontal circular path. The point $P$ indicate the point at the center of the circular path of the bob as shown. The angle of the ideal string with respect to the vertical is constant and given as $\theta$. The length of the string $l$ is also given.

## a

Draw a careful and complete Free-Body-Diagram showing all of the forces on the bob. Be sure to include an appropriately labeled coordinate system.

## b

Calculate the magnitude of the force of Tension on the string. Explain your work. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters.
Hint: Apply Newton’s Second Law in the vertical Component.



## c

Calculate the angular speed ω of the conical pendulum. Explain your work. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters.
Hint: Apply Newton’s Second Law in the centripetal component. Use the Rolling Constraint: $v =\omega r$ that relates the (linear) speed of an object with Uniform Circular Motion to the angular speed of rotation about the axis.
