A truck pulls a box up a ramp at a constant given constant acceleration $A$ as shown above with an ideal rope. The angle of the ramp is given as $\theta$. The wheels of the truck pull the truck up with no slipping and no sliding. The box is greased on the bottom surface so that there is a given coefficient of sliding friction between the box and the ramp of $\mu$. The mass of the truck is given as $m_t$ and the mass of the box is given as $m_b$.

## a

Draw a careful Free Body Diagram for both the truck and the box. Include a proper coordinate system and be sure to indicate every force on each body. Make very sure you have each force clearly and properly labeled. At this time we expect all students use the format and notation given in this class for every FBD.

## b

In terms of given parameters $A$, $mt$ , $mb$ , $\mu$ and $\theta$, determine the magnitude of each and every force on both the truck and the box. Note: thee are four forces on each. Be sure you find all eight forces and express your answers in terms of the given parameters.
