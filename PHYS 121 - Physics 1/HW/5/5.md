A truck pulls a box up a ramp at a constant given constant acceleration A as shown above with an ideal rope. The angle of the ramp is given as θ. The wheels of the truck pull the truck up with no
slipping and no sliding. The box is greased on the bottom surface so that there is a given coefficient
of sliding friction between the box and the ramp of μ. The mass of the truck is given as mt and the
mass of the box is given as mb .
