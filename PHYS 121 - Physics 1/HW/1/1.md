## a

Three students make statements. Only one of these three students is correct. Which student is correct and why? Explain your answer.

1. At time $t = 0$ we know the particle has zero velocity because particles must start at rest.
2. No, you are wrong. In fact at time $t = 0$ we know the particle is already moving in the negative direction. In fact the particle is slowing down.
3. No, you are both wrong. At time $t = 0$ the particle is speeding up. We know this because the slope is positive.

> [!answer]
> ![[image71-a.png]]
> 
> 1. This statement is incorrect as we can see that at $t=0$, $v_x(0)=-5$, which means the object is moving at $-5\frac{m}{s}$ — not at rest — at the start.
> 2. This is true. As we established in (1), it begins with moving at $-5 \frac{m}{s}$. We can also see that the slope is upwards, which means that the acceleration is positive. When velocity is negative and acceleration is positive, it means that the object is slowing down, as they oppose each other.
> 3. This is false as we established the slope is positive while the velocity is negative, causing the velocity to *increase* but the speed to *decrease* as the velocity moves towards 0 at $t=0$

## b

Is the acceleration of the particle constant during this the entire interval shown here? How do you know this? Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> ![[image71-b.png]]
> 
> No, the acceleration is not constant during the entire interval. As you can see in the image, it begins positive at $t=0$ and stays positive until about $t=2.3s$ where the the slope of velocity is flat, which means $a=0$. After this, the acceleration turns negative. We can also see that the velocity curve is always concave down, which means the acceleration vs time graph is always decreasing, further proving the point it isn't constant.

> No
> $\square$

## c

Consider the following equation:

$x(t)=x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$

In principle, can we apply this equation to describe the motion of the particle during this entire interval? Yes or No? How do you know this? Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> No, this equation assumes we have constant acceleration across the entire time interval (hence $a$ not being a function of $t$). As we have established in part (b), $a$ is not constant across the entire time interval, which means we cannot use this equation.
> 
> ---
> 
> No
> $\square$

## d

Are there one or more instants in time that corresponds to **zero acceleration** of the particle? If so, indicate the time(s) (in seconds) and explain:
How do you know that the indicates time(s) corresponds to zero acceleration? Very important: Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> Yes, as we established in part (b), the acceleration is $0$ at around $t=2.3s$. We know the acceleration is $0$ here because acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, which means it is equivalent to the slope on a velocity vs. time graph. At around $t=2.3s$ in the graph of part (b), we see the slope is flat — or $0$.
> 
> ---
> 
> Yes, $a(2.3s)=0$
> $\square$

## e

Is there any single instant in time that corresponds to the **minimum position** of the particle? If so, what time is this and how do you know that this is the minimum position? Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> ![[image71-e.png]]
> Yes, at $t=0.5s$, which is when the velocity switches from negative to positive. Since position is the integral of velocity with respect to time, when the velocity turns positive after $t=0.5s$. The position of the particle will begin to increase. We can also know the minimum by the other characteristics of the velocity graph: when $v=0$ we know the particle does not move, and thus its position vs. time graph has a slope of $0$. Since velocity has a positive slope at this time, we know that the position is concave up at that point, making the zero slope at that point a local minima. Since there are no other local maxima or minima and we know that the position is less at $t=0.5s$ than $t=0$ or $t=3.6s$ as the integral from $\bigg|_{t=0}^{0.5}$ is negative, making it further right and $\bigg|_{t=0.5}^{3.6}$ is positive, making it further right, we can conclude the local minima at $t=0.5s$ is the global minimum.
> 
> ---
> 
> $t_{xmin}=0.5s$
> $\square$

## f

Estimate the acceleration of the particle at the instant corresponding to $t = 1.0s$. Important: You **must** explicitly show your numerical calculations in a complete way and you must explicitly reference the graph to explain **how in terms of some graphical** method you used the graph to calculate this. Be careful with the units!

> [!answer]
> ![[image71-f.png]]
> 
> We can estimate the acceleration by taking the slope of the tangent line to the velocity vs. time graph at $t=1.0s$. I drew a tangent line at $t=1.0s$ on the graph and saw that its slope was roughly equal to $+6$ blocks up and $+4$ blocks right, which corresponds to $\frac{6 \frac{m}{s}}{0.8s}=7.5 \frac{m}{s^2}$.
> 
> ---
> 
> $a(1.0s)=7.5 \frac{m}{s^2}$
> $\square$

## g

Harder and more time consuming: Estimate the *final position* of the particle $x(t)$ at time $t = 3.6s$ relative to the initial position $x = 0$ at $t = 0$ seconds. There are several approximately correct graphical ways to do this. As long as you are consistent, any method that gives reasonable accurate results is acceptable. Again, you must use words and **use the graph** to explain **how in terms of some graphical method** you you calculate this. Clearly demonstrate to the grader how you obtained your answer. Be careful with the units!

> [!answer]
> ![[image71-g.png]]
> 
> The position at time $t$ is equal to the original position $x_0=0$ at $t=0$ plus the integral over the time interval of velocity. Taking the integral of the velocity over the entire time frame could be estimated by taking the area under the curve of velocity over the time, which is approximately $107$blocks, at $1 \frac{m}{s}\times0.2s=0.2m$ per block, this gives us the estimated integral at $21.4m$. Adding the initial position of $0$ gives us the final position $21.4m$ at $t=3.6s$

> ---

> $x(3.6s)=21.4m$

Important: use the equations of Free-Fall Kinematics to solve this problem symbolically in terms of the given parameters. Here the given parameters are $M$ and $H$.

The dwarf planet Sedna is at a distance $D = 85 AU$ (Astronomical
Units) from the Earth. You want to fly a space-ship to Sedna. Suppose you have a space-ship that is able to linearly accelerate in either a positive or a negative direction at exactly $A = 0.238 \frac{m}{s^2}$. You plan a trip where you move with constant positive acceleration in a straight line toward Sedna, speeding up the whole time, and then, at precisely the half-way point, you turn the ship around and accelerate in the opposite direction e.g., with negative acceleration of the same magnitude so that you are now slowing down. **By symmetry**, if you reverse acceleration at the half-way point, you should arrive at your destination with zero velocity (right?).
Note: in this problem we are completely ignoring the practical reality of how one might build a spaceship that can sustain constant acceleration for an arbitrary period of time. We are also ignoring the motion of the Earth and of Sedna during the trip.

## a

How long will the trip take? Important: You must given a **symbolic** answer in terms of the given parameters (here $A$ and $D$ corresponding to the acceleration of the spaceship and the distance traveled to Sedna. Box your symbolic answer. Also give a numerical answer in terms of seconds. Be sure that the answer has an appropriate number of significant digits. Box your numerical answer. Also convert your answer in seconds to an answer in units that are most appropriate to actual length of the trip (days, years, etc.) Again box your answer. Show your work. Hint: you will need to convert from “$AU$” to meters.
