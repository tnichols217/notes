## a

Three students make statements. Only one of these three students is correct. Which student is correct and why? Explain your answer.

1. At time $t = 0$ we know the particle has zero velocity because particles must start at rest.
2. No, you are wrong. In fact at time $t = 0$ we know the particle is already moving in the negative direction. In fact the particle is slowing down.
3. No, you are both wrong. At time $t = 0$ the particle is speeding up. We know this because the slope is positive.

> 1. This statement is incorrect as we can see that at $t=0$, $v_x(0)=-5$, which means the object is moving at $-5\frac{m}{s}$ — not at rest — at the start.
> 2. This is true. As we established in (1), it begins with moving at $-5 \frac{m}{s}$. We can also see that the slope is upwards, which means that the acceleration is positive. When velocity is negative and acceleration is positive, it means that the object is slowing down, as they oppose each other.
> 3. This is false as we established the slope is positive while the velocity is negative, causing the velocity to *increase* but the speed to *decrease* as the velocity moves towards 0 at $t=0$

## b

Is the acceleration of the particle constant during this the entire interval shown here? How do you know this? Explain your answer.

> No, the acceleration is not constant during the entire interval. As you can see in the image, it begins positive at $t=0$ and stays positive until about $t=2.3s$ where the the slope of velocity is flat, which means $a=0$. After this, the acceleration turns negative. We can also see that the velocity curve is always concave down, which means the acceleration vs time graph is always decreasing, further proving the point it isn't constant.

## c

Consider the following equation:

$x(t)=x_0+v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$

In principle, can we apply this equation to describe the motion of the particle during this entire interval? Yes or No? How do you know this? Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> No, this equation assumes we have constant acceleration across the entire time interval (hence $a$ not being a function of $t$). As we have established in part (b), $a$ is not constant across the entire time interval, which means we cannot use this equation.

## d

Are there one or more instants in time that corresponds to zero acceleration of the particle? If so, indicate the time(s) (in seconds) and explain:
How do you know that the indicates time(s) corresponds to zero acceleration? Very important: Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> Yes, as we established in part (b), the acceleration is $0$ at around $t=2.3s$. We know the acceleration is $0$ here because acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, which means it is equivalent to the slope on a velocity vs. time graph. At around $t=2.3s$ in the graph of part (b), we see the slope is flat — or $0$.

## e

Is there any single instant in time that corresponds to the minimum position of the particle? If so, what time is this and how do you know that this is the minimum position? Explain your answer.
