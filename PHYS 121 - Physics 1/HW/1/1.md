Three students make statements. Only one of these three students is correct. Which student is correct and why? Explain your answer.

1. At time $t = 0$ we know the particle has zero velocity because particles must start at rest.
2. No, you are wrong. In fact at time $t = 0$ we know the particle is already moving in the negative direction. In fact the particle is slowing down.
3. No, you are both wrong. At time $t = 0$ the particle is speeding up. We know this because the slope is positive.

> 1. This statement is incorrect as we can see that at $t=0$, $v_x(0)=-5$, which means the object is moving $-\frac{5m}{s}$
