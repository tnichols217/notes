A round marble with a given mass $m$ and given radius $r$ is placed inside a smooth spherical bowl as shown. The radius of curvature for the inside of the bowl is given as $R$ and the marble is released at rest at a position corresponding to a given angle $\theta_0$ relative to the the vertical radius line as shown. Assume $r << R$. Assume that $\theta_0$ is small enough so that the marble rolls without slipping.
