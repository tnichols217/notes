A round marble with a given mass $m$ and given radius $r$ is placed inside a smooth spherical bowl as shown. The radius of curvature for the inside of the bowl is given as $R$ and the marble is released at rest at a position corresponding to a given angle $\theta_0$ relative to the the vertical radius line as shown. Assume $r << R$. Assume that $\theta_0$ is small enough so that the marble rolls without slipping.

# 2

A thin rod of given mass $m$ is attached to an hinge so that it can swing vertically. The length of the rod is given as $l$ and the rotational inertial of the rod about one end is $I = \frac{1}{3} ml^2$ . The rod is held in place at a given angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal by an guy wire which we represent as an ideal string which connects the far end of the bar to the wall as shown.

## a

Draw a careful and properly labeled Free-Body Diagram (FBD) that shows all of the forces on the thin rod. Also, draw a careful and properly labeled Extended Free-Body Diagram (XFBD) for the thin rod. In your diagrams, the unknown hinge force should be represented by two components, $H_H$ and $H_V$, corresponding to the horizontal and vertical components respectively.

## b

Calculate the magnitudes of both $H_V$ and $H_H$. Express your answers in terms of the given parameters. Explain. Hint: for this part use a coordinate system that is lined up with the Hinge Force components (not tilted). Another hint: $\sin(90\degree-\theta) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\theta \right) = \cos \theta$.

## c

Suppose the guy wire is cut so that the rod is suddenly free to begin to rotate on the hinge. What is the magnitude of the acceleration of the center-of-mass point of the rod just at the instant after the wire is cut? Express your answer in term of the given parameters. Explain your work. Hint: for this part use a coordinate system that is tilted so that it is aligned with the instantaneous direction of acceleration.

## d

After the wire is cut, the rod swings down and collides flush with the wall. What is $\omega _{hit}$, the angular speed of the rod at the instant just before it hits the wall? Express your answer in  term of the given parameters. Explain your work.

# 3

A ladder of given length $L$ and mass $M$ leans at rest against the wall at a given angle $\theta$ as shown. Assume that the surface of the wall is frictionless, but assume that the floor applies both a Normal force and an Friction force to the ladder.

## a

Draw a Free Body Diagram and also an Extended Free Body Diagram for the ladder. Be sure to label each of your forces appropriately.

## b

Calculate the magnitude of each and every force on the ladder. Present your answers in terms of given parameters. Explain your work.

## c

Suppose the coefficients of kinetic friction and static friction are given as $\mu_k$ and $\mu_s$ respectively. What is the constraint that applies to the value of $\theta$ that ensures that the ladder stays at rest and does not slip and fall down? Explain your work.
