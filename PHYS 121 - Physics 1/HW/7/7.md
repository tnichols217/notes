A round marble with a given mass $m$ and given radius $r$ is placed inside a smooth spherical bowl as shown. The radius of curvature for the inside of the bowl is given as $R$ and the marble is released at rest at a position corresponding to a given angle $\theta_0$ relative to the the vertical radius line as shown. Assume $r << R$. Assume that $\theta_0$ is small enough so that the marble rolls without slipping.

## a

Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD) indicating the forces on the marble at the point it is released. Be sure to include a proper coordinate system that is aligned with the direction of acceleration.

## b

Draw an Extended Free Body Diagram (XFBD) indicating the forces on the marble at the point it is released. Be sure to indicate a “pivot point” and also indicate the direction of positive torque.

## c

Calculate the magnitude and direction of the torque about the center of the marble that is applied to the marble at the point instantly after it is released. Give you answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

## d

Calculate the magnitude of the translational acceleration of the marble at the point instantly after it is released? Give you answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

## e
