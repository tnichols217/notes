Chris is on a skateboard that is traveling at a constant horizontal speed $v_x = 4.35 ~m/s$. They hold a ball in their hand at a height of $h = 1.22~ m$ above the ground and then they toss the ball “up” (as seen in their frame) so that they catch it back in their hand exactly $T=2.85 s$ later.

## a

Suppose there is a tiny motionless bug on the ground immediately below Chris’ hand at the instant when they toss the ball upward. Suppose we define standard unit vectors $\hat i$ and $\hat j$ corresponding to the frame of reference for the bug. Write down vector expressions for the position, velocity, and acceleration of the ball ($\vec r,\vec v,\vec a$) as a function of time, $t$ as seen by the bug at the instant of time just before the ball is caught by Chris. Explain your answer.

Leonard Nimoy stands at the edge of a cliff at a given elevation $h$ above the still waters of Lake Erie as shown in the figure. He throws a tennis ball at a given speed $v_0$ at a given angle of $\theta$ above the horizontal direction towards the Lake. Then he throws a second tennis ball at the same speed $v_0$ but downwards at an given angle $\phi$ below the horizontal. Here assume $\theta > \phi$.

## a

What is the maximum vertical distance relative to the surface of the Lake that the first tennis ball will achieve? Give you answer in terms of the given parameters (not time). Explain how you got you answer in one or two sentences.

> [!answer]
> We can find the max height using the conservation of energy.
> $K_i=mv_0^2$ Where $m$ is the mass of the tennis ball
> $U_i=mgh$ No gravitational potential at the start
> 
> $K_f=mv_f^2$
> $U_f=mgh_f$
> 
> $K_i+U_i+W=K_f+U_f$ No work other than gravity is being done, so $W=0$
> 
> $mv_0^2+mgh=mv_f^2+mgh_f$
> $v_0^2+gh=v_f^2+gh_f$
> 
> When the ball is at its max height, its vertical velocity will be zero.
> Additionally, we know nothing influences the horizontal velocity, so it must remain constant
> 
> $\vec v_0=v_0\langle \cos\theta,\sin\theta\rangle$
> $\vec v_f=v_0\langle\cos\theta,0\rangle$
> 
> $v_0^2+gh=(v_0\cos\theta)^2+gh_f$
> $h_f=\frac{v_0^2-(v_0\cos\theta)^2}{g}+h$
> $h_f=\frac{v_0^2(1-\cos^2\theta)}{g}+h$
> $h_f=\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{g}+h$
> 
> ---
> 
> $h_f=\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{g}+h$
> $\square$

## b

Write down three vector expressions – one for the position, one for the velocity and one for the acceleration – corresponding to the motion of the first tennis ball just at the instant it achieves maximum vertical distance relative to the surface of the Lake. Your answer should be expressed in terms of given parameters only; note that if you have an expression that is a function of time $t$ you are not done. Your expression should include relevant Cartesian basis unit-vectors. Explain how you got you answer in one or two sentences.

> [!answer]
> Since the only force acting upon the tennis ball is the force of gravity.
> $\vec a=\langle 0, -g\rangle$
> 
> We have already calculated the velocity in part (a).
> $\vec v=\langle v_0\cos\theta,0\rangle$
> 
> As for the position, we already know the max height
> $h_y=\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{g}+h$
> 
> We can calculate the time it took to the peak by using the velocity acceleration relationship.
> $\vec v(t)=\vec v_0+\vec a t$
> $v_0\langle\cos\theta,0\rangle=v_0\langle \cos\theta,\sin\theta\rangle+\langle 0, -g\rangle t$
> $0=v_0\sin\theta-gt$
> $t=\frac{v_0\sin\theta}{g}$
> 
> We can then use the velocity position relation to find the $x$ position.
> $x=x_0+v_xt$
> $x=\frac{v_0^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g}$
> 
> $\vec p=\langle\frac{v_0^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g},\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{g}+h\rangle$
> 
> ---
> 
> $\vec a=\langle 0, -g\rangle$

> $\vec p=\langle\frac{v_0^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g},\frac{(v_0\sin\theta)^2}{g}+h\rangle$
> 
> Where $\langle a, b\rangle=a\hat x+b\hat y$

## c

The first tennis ball makes a parabolic curved path as it travels through the air. Calculate the radius of curvature on that path at the single point corresponding to when the tennis ball has maximum vertical distance relative to the surface of the Lake. Your answer should be expressed in terms of given parameters only; note that if you have an expression of time $t$ you are not done. Explain how you got your answer in one or two sentences.
