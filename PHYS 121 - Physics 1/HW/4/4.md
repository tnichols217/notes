Chris is on a skateboard that is traveling at a constant horizontal speed $v_x = 4.35 ~m/s$. They hold a ball in their hand at a height of $h = 1.22~ m$ above the ground and then they toss the ball “up” (as seen in their frame) so that they catch it back in their hand exactly $T=2.85 s$ later.

## a

Relative to Chris’ hand, what is the speed of the ball as it it travels upward? Explain your answer.

## b

Relative to the fixed ground, what is the maximum height of the ball in the air? Explain your answer.

> [!answer]
> There will be maxima and minima in the ball's vertical position when the velocity is equal to $0$.
