Suppose a block of given mass $m$ is attached to a spring of given spring constant $k$ and released on a frictionless surface with an initial horizontal velocity given as $v_0$ at time $t = 0$. At time $t = 0$ the block is located at the equilibrium position corresponding to $x = 0$ as shown:

We showed in class that the Equation of Motion for a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is this:

$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{k}{m}x=0$

We also showed that the general solution for the Equation of Motion of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is given by this equation:

$x(t) = B \cos(\omega t) + C \sin(\omega t)$

Determine the particular values of $\omega$, $B$, and $C$ that correspond to this particular system. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters: $m$, $k$, and $v_0$. Explain how you know this.
Hint: Consider the value of $x$ at time $t = 0$. Now consider the value of $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$ at time $t = 0$.
