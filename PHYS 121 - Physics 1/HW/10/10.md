Suppose a block of given mass $m$ is attached to a spring of given spring constant $k$ and released on a frictionless surface with an initial horizontal velocity given as $v_0$ at time $t = 0$. At time $t = 0$ the block is located at the equilibrium position corresponding to $x = 0$ as shown:

We showed in class that the Equation of Motion for a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is this:

$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{k}{m}x=0$

We also showed that the general solution for the Equation of Motion of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator is given by this equation:

$x(t) = B \cos(\omega t) + C \sin(\omega t)$

Determine the particular values of $\omega$, $B$, and $C$ that correspond to this particular system. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters: $m$, $k$, and $v_0$. Explain how you know this.
Hint: Consider the value of $x$ at time $t = 0$. Now consider the value of $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$ at time $t = 0$.

Suppose a space-station is designed in a shape of a torus such as this one depicted in Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A space Odyssey” below:

Suppose the space station has a diameter of 175 meters. At what rotational rate should the station be spun so that occupants standing on the inside surface of the outer wall (maximum distance from the center) experience earth-normal artificial gravity? Give your answer in terms of rotations per minute.

Suppose that inside the space station there is a transport cart for transport around the rim that can reach a maximum speed of 25.0 meters per second. Using such a cart, how could you tell which way the space station from spinning from inside without looking out any windows? Be quite specific about what you experience when you drive around with the cart in one direction or the other.

Joe the plumber pushes a contraption up a ramp at a given small angle θ as shown at a given constant acceleration A.
 ~ A small box of mass m is in contact with the vertical surface of the
contraption as shown.
a) Assume that there is static friction between the small box and the contraption. The coeffi-
cient of static friction between the box and the contraption is μ. Calculate the direction and the
magnitude of all forces on the small box in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.
b) Suppose the small box contains a mini-aquarium with water and fish. Assuming that the
system is in equilibrium, with what angle will the surface of the water inside the aquarium make
with respect to the horizontal? Explain how you know this.
