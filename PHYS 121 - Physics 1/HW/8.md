Neytiri is standing on the end of a long thing uniform board of length $L$. Half of the board including the end where Neytiri is standing rests on very slippery ice with the other half over open water as shown. Lucky for our calculations, the board and Neytiri have the same mass $M$.

## a

Find the $x$ coordinate, relative to the ice, of the overall CM of Neytiri and the board. Define $x=0$ at her end, and $x=L$ at the other end.

## b

If Neytiri walks alll the way to the
