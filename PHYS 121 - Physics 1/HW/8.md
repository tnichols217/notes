Neytiri is standing on the end of a long thing uniform board of length $L$. Half of the board including the end where Neytiri is standing rests on very slippery ice with the other half over open water as shown. Lucky for our calculations, the board and Neytiri have the same mass $M$.

## a

Find the $x$ coordinate, relative to the ice, of the overall CM of Neytiri and the board. Define $x=0$ at her end, and $x=L$ at the other end.

## b

If Neytiri walks alll the way to the other end, will she fall into the water? Give your reasoning.

## c

Suppose Neytiri moves at a speed $v$ **relative to the ice**, while she is walking to the right as describled in part (b) from her original end position. What is the CM velocity?

## d

How fast is the board moving relative to the ice and in what direction, if Neytiri is moving at speed $v$ to the right?

Consider two stars, each in its own *circular* orbit around a common CM point as shown below:
