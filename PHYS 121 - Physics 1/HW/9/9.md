Consider a new force which is defined as a function of two-dimensional coordinates this way:

$\vec F\equiv Ay\hat i+Bx^4\hat j$

Here $x$ and $y$ are standard Cartesian coordinates and $A$ and $B$ are given real positive constants with appropriate units.

Consider the loop that goes around a square path as show in the figure. Each side of the square has a given length $C$.

## a

What is the **Work** done by this specific force $\vec F$ for the closed path that goes around the loop in the counter-clockwise direction, starting from the origin $(0, 0)$?
Important: You must explicitly calculate the path integral here. Explain your work. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters.

## b

Based on your calculation from Part (a), answer this question: Is this force $\vec F$ Conservative or Not Conservative? Cite specific evidence and/or examples to support your claim either way. Explain your work completely here to get full credit.

> [!answer]
> No, it is non-conservative as a closed loop interval is non-zero.

Two astronauts, Lucy, and Ringo, are floating free in deep space, as shown. Each astronaut is defined to have zero velocity. Lucy has a mass $m_L$ of $40~ kg$. She holds a wrench of mass $m_w$ of $10~ kg$. Ringo has a mass $m_R$ of $90~ kg$. Lucy throws a the wrench at Ringo. She throws the wrench so that it moves towards Ringo at a translational speed $v_w$ of $5~ \frac{m}{s}$. She also puts a rather good spin on the wrench, so that it rotates with an angular velocity $\omega_w$ of $16$ radians per second. Ringo then catches the wrench. Assume that the wrench has a rotational inertia given as $I_{wrench}=0.2~kgm^2$ and assume that Lucy has a rotational inertia that is 80 times that of the wrench. Assume Ringo has a rotational inertia that is 125 times that of the wrench.

A common recreational fixture in children’s outdoor playgrounds is the “merry-go-round” which is generally a large circular platform mounted on a central bearing so that the platform can spin freely.

A “bird’s-eye-view” of a merry-go-round is shown above. Assume that the bearing is ideal and that the total rotational inertia of the merry-go-round alone is given as $I_m$. Assume a small child with given mass $m$ leaps from the ground with horizontal velocity given as $v_c$ and then lands and sticks on the merry-go-round at a given distance $R$ from the center. Assume that the child impacts the merry-go-round at a given angle $\phi$ relative to the radial direction as shown. Treat the child as a point-like-object. Ignore all vertical motion of the child. Assume the merry-go-round is initially moving with an angular speed of $\omega_0$ in the clock-wise direction as shown.

## a

What is the magnitude of the total angular momentum $L_{tot}$ for the combined child-plus-merry-go-round system in the instant just before the child comes in contact with the merry-go-round as calculated for the pivot point corresponding to the central axle of the merry-go-round? Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

> $I=mR^2$
> $L_c=mR^2v_c\sin\phi$
> $L_{tot}=I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi$
> 
> ---
> 
> $L_{tot}=I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi$
> $\square$

## b

Assume the merry-go-round is initially moving with a given angular speed of $\omega_0$ but then comes up to angular speed $\omega_1$ just after the child leaps on. Calculate the value of $\omega_1$. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

> [!answer]
> $I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi=(I_m+mR^2)\omega_1$ Conservation of angular momentum
> $\omega_1=\frac{I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi}{I_m+mR^2}$
> 
> ---
> 
> $\omega_1=\frac{I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi}{I_m+mR^2}$
> $\square$

## c

Now assume that the child subsequently pushes straight off the merry-go-round so as to land just off the outside edge on the ground with precisely zero horizontal velocity. What is the angular speed $\omega_2$ of the merry-go-round after the child performs this maneuver? Express your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

> [!answer]
> $I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi=I_m\omega_3$
> $\omega_3=\frac{I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi}{I_m}$
> 
> ---
> 
> $\omega_3=\frac{I_m\omega_0+mR^2v_c\sin\phi}{I_m}$
