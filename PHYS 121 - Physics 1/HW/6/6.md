Three blocks, are placed on a frictionless surface as shown above. Block A has a given mass of $m$, Block B has a given mass of $2m$ and Block C has a given mass of $5m$. Block A has initial velocity given as $v_0$ while the other two blocks are initially at rest. Then the following happens:

- First Collision: Block A collides with Block B and this collision is totally inelastic.
- Second Collision: Block B collides with Block C and this collision is totally elastic.

Three blocks A, B, and C with a given mass $m_A$, $m_B$ , and $m_C$ respectively, are positioned as shown above. Blocks B and C are accelerated to the left along the frictionless surface. The pulley is ideal as is the string between Blocks A and B. A massive rope of mass $m_r$ connects Blocks B and C. Assume that the rope sits flush on the frictionless surface so that there is no component of the tension in the vertical direction.

## a

Rank the four tension forces from largest to smallest. Explain how you determined this.
Hint: this is a *conceptual* question. No algebra or calculations required. Important hint: any solution that includes either of the words “system” or “motion” is probably not correct. You want to invoke a Law of Physics here.

> [!answer]
> As the whole system is accelerating together constantly, the tension pulling the most mass will have the most tension $(F^\uparrow=m^\uparrow a)$
> 
> $T_1=T_2>T_3>T_4$
> $\square$

## b

Determine the magnitude of the acceleration a of Block A. Explain your work. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters. Hint: you will simplify your calculation if you consider these three items: Blocks B, Block C and the massive rope, altogether, as one “system”.

> [!answer]
> If we treat the entire system as a system, the only external force being applied is on block A.
> 
> $F_{net}=gm_A$
> $a_t=\frac{gm_A}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$ acceleration of the entire system in the direction of tension.
> $a_A=\frac{gm_A}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$  acceleration of the system in the direction of tension will be the same as the acceleration of block A.
> 
> ---
> 
> $a_A=\frac{gm_A}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$
> $\square$

## c

Assume that the massive rope has length $L$. Determine the tension *in the massive rope* as a function of horizontal position $x$ along the rope measured relative to the right edge of Block B. Give your answer in terms of the given parameters. Explain your work.

> [!answer]
> Assuming the rope's mass is equally distributed, the force will also be equally distributed as the acceleration is constant.
> $F\propto m$
> $T(x=0)=T_3=\frac{gm_A(m_r+m_C)}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$
> $T(x=L)=T_4=\frac{gm_Am_C}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$
> 
> We know $T(x)$ is linear w.r.t. $x$ due to the prior relation
> 
> $T(x)=\left( m_r+\left( 1-\frac{x}{L} \right)m_C \right)\frac{gm_A}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$ By linear interpolation
> 
> ---
> 
> $T(x)=\left( m_r+\left( 1-\frac{x}{L} \right)m_C \right)\frac{gm_A}{m_A+m_B+m_r+m_C}$

Two blocks A and B each with mass $m= 2.0~kg$ sit on a frictionless surface. Block A has a velocity $v_0=5.0~ \frac{m}{s}$ towards block B which is at rest. There is a massless spring with spring constant $k=1.00~ \frac{N}{m}$ attached to Block B as shown. Block A collides with the spring that is attached Block B. The spring is compressed, and then after a while it is uncompressed and the two blocks separate from each other. Note that because the spring force is Conservative, the collision is ***totally elastic***.

## a

What is the final velocity of block A? What is the final velocity of block B? Be sure to show your work.

## b

Consider the system which is made of block A, block B, and the spring. On the following figure make a *qualitative plot* of the position of the center of mass $x_{cm}$ for this entire system as a function of time. Start and end your plot at the points indicated. What is the slope of your plot during the intervals of time corresponding to each of these three periods: (1) before, (2) during, and (3) after the collision? Be sure to explain your work. Use physics!
