Three blocks, are placed on a frictionless surface as shown above. Block A has a given mass of $m$, Block B has a given mass of $2m$ and Block C has a given mass of $5m$. Block A has initial velocity given as $v_0$ while the other two blocks are initially at rest. Then the following happens:

- First Collision: Block A collides with Block B and this collision is totally inelastic.
- Second Collision: Block B collides with Block C and this collision is totally elastic.

## a

Determine the final velocity of every block immediately after the First Collision.


## b

Determine the final velocity of every block immediately after the Second Collision.


## c

Suppose we define $V_{CM}$ as the velocity of the Center-of-Mass of the *entire system* of three blocks, A, B, and C. What is $V_{CM}$ just before the First collision. What is $V_{CM}$ just after this First Collision? What is VCM just after this Second Collision?
