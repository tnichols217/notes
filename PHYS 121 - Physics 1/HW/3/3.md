A strange science-fiction battle takes on a tiny moon in deep space; here, the moon is so small that we can completely ignore gravity. A deranged invading space monster of given mass $28.2~ kg$ kicks off a rocky structure to achieve a horizontal speed of $3.45~ m/s$ directly toward a startled space cadet. The cadet is braced firmly on the surface of the moon and is armed with a rapid-fire automatic marshmallow blaster gun which fires multiple sticky marshmallows toward the monster, each of mass $11.5 ~g$ and each with a speed of $53.4~ m/s$. The cadet attempts to stop the monster with the marshmallow gun, slowing the monster down by hitting the monster with marshmallow after marshmallow until the monster is finally brought to a stop. How many marshmallows will the cadet have to fire at the monster to stop the monster’s horizontal motion? (Assume each fired marshmallow harmlessly sticks to the monster. Assume that the monster is flying horizontally, with no vertical motion and no friction or other forces on the monster except for those due to the collision with the marshmallows. Explain your work. Indicate what Physics Concept (law of physics) you used to solve this problem.

A medicine ball with given mass $M = 8.11~kg$ drops vertically, eventually hitting the floor. Just before impact, the ball has a given downward speed of $5.11~ m/s$. It then rebounds straight back with a given upward speed of $4.42~ m/s$.

## a

What is conserved with respect to the system that is defined as the medicine ball during the entire collision? Is Mechanical Energy Conserved? Is Linear Momentum Conserved? Explain how you know this?

## b

What is the total impulse imparted to the ball as a result of contact with the floor?

## c

 If the ball is in contact for a time interval $\Delta t = 0.056 s$, what is the average force exerted on the floor during this collision?

You are driving a car that is moves with constant given speed $V$ . Your mass is given as m and the mass of the car (not including yourself) is given as $M$ . The road is completely flat and level. The car enters a curve in the road that can be described as a circular arc with given radius $R$ as shown above in a “bird’s-eye” view of the path of the car. Assume you are properly secured into your seat as you drive.

## a

What is the magnitude of the net force on you, the driver, as you go around the curve?
Explain how you know this.
