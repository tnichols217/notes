# Spring Potential Energy

## Method

- Put a meter stick next to the string, parallel, with numbering visible from the side through the string
- Measure the tip of the hook of the spring at different weights

### Finding $k$

The force on the spring can be calculated by the amount of mass hanging on it.

$F_s=F_g=mg$
$F_s=k\Delta x$

The slope represents: $\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}$

$mg=k\Delta x$
$g=k\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}$
$k=\frac{g}{\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}}$
$k=\frac{9.81}{3.13}$
$k=3.134~ \frac{N}{m}$

### Finding $\delta_{k}$

$k=\frac{g}{\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}}$

The variance in $g$ is negligible compared to that of $\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}$

Let $s=\frac{d\Delta x}{dm}$

$\delta_k=\delta_{ks}=\delta_{s} \frac{g}{s^2}$

# Abstract

The purpose for this lab is to establish whether energy is truly conserved and stored within springs, gravity (height), and motion.
