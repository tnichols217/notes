$\text{Unstretched Spring}=93.90~\text{cm}$

## Method

- Put a meter stick next to the string, parallel, with numbering visible from the side through the string
- Measure the tip of the hook of the spring at different weights

# Abstract

The purpose for this lab is to establish whether energy is truly conserved and stored within springs, gravity (height), and motion.
