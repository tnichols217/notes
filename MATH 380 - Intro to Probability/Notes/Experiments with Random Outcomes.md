# Sample Space

## The sample space

The **sample space** — often denoted by $\Omega$ — defines the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. Samples of $\Omega$ are called **sample points** and often represented by $\omega$.

Subsets of the sample space are called **events**, and the collection of possible events in $\Omega$ is often denoted by $\mathbf F$. This can be the set of all subsets or not depending on constraints.

## The Probability function

The **Probability Measure** function $P$ is a function $\mathbf F\to\mathbb R$ that measures the probability of that event happening.

It must satisfy the following axioms:

1. $0\le P(A)\le 1:A\in\mathbf F$
2. $P(\Omega)=1;P(\emptyset)=0$
3. If $A_{1},A_{2,}A_{3},\dots A_{n}$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events, then: $P(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^nA_{i})=\sum\limits\limits_{i=1}^{n}P(A_{i})$

## The Probability Model

The probability model consists of a sample space, event space, and a probability measure.

It is typically denoted as $(\Omega, \mathbf F, P)$
