## 1.5

In one type of state lottery $5$ distinct numbers are picked from $1, 2, 3, \dots, 40$ uniformly at random.

### a

Describe a sample space $\Omega$ and a probability measure $P$ to model this experiment.

> Assuming replacement of the number, and independence in drawings
> 
> Let $\alpha=\{1, 2, 3,\dots,40\}$

> Let $A$ be when exactly 3 of the 5 numbers are even
> 
> Where $\forall \omega\in\Omega:P(\{\omega\})=\frac{35!}{40!}$

What is the probability that out of the 5 picked numbers exactly three will be
even?

> 
> $\frac{5!}{3!2!}$ possible permutations of $\frac{20!}{17!}\frac{20!}{18!}$ combinations.

## 1.7

We have an urn with 3 green and 4 yellow balls. We draw 3 balls one by one without replacement.

### a

Find the probability that the colors we see in order are green, yellow, green.

> [!answer]
> $\frac{3}{7}\cdot \frac{4}{6}\cdot \frac{2}{5}=\frac{24}{210}=\frac{4}{35}$
> $\square$

### b

> GYG: $\frac{3}{7}\cdot \frac{4}{6}\cdot \frac{2}{5}=\frac{24}{210}=\frac{4}{35}$
> YGG: $\frac{4}{7}\cdot \frac{3}{6}\cdot \frac{2}{5}=\frac{24}{210}=\frac{4}{35}$
> GGY: $\frac{3}{7}\cdot \frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{4}{5}=\frac{24}{210}=\frac{4}{35}$

## 1.10

We roll a fair die repeatedly until we see the number four appear and then we stop. The outcome of the experiment is the number of rolls.

### a

Following Example 1.16 describe a sample space $\Omega$ and a probability measure $P$ to model this situation.

> [!answer]
> Let $\Omega=\{\infty, 1, 2,\dots\}$
> $\forall\omega\in\Omega:P(\{\omega\})=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\omega-1}\cdot\frac{1}{6}$

### b

Calculate the probability that the number four never appears.

> [!answer]
> $\lim\limits_{\omega\to\infty}P(\{\omega\})=\lim\limits_{\omega\to\infty}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\omega-1}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=0$
> 
> ---
> 
> $P(\{\infty\})=0$

## 1.12

We roll a fair die repeatedly until we see the number four appear and then we stop.

### a

What is the probability that we need at most 3 rolls?

> [!answer]
> The probability of needing 1, 2, or 3 rolls is equivalent to not needing more than rolls.
> 
> $P(\omega>3)=\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{3}$
> $P(\omega\le3)=1-\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{3}=\frac{91}{216}$
> 
> ---
> 
> $P(\omega\le3)=\frac{91}{216}$
> $\square$

### b

What is the probability that we needed an even number of die rolls?

> [!answer]
> Since the number of rolls are disjoint, we may add the probabilities directly.
> 
> $P(\omega\text{ is even})=P(\{2\})+P(\{4\})+P(\{6\})+\dots$
> $=\frac{5}{36}\left( 1+\frac{25}{36}+(\frac{26}{36})^{2}+... \right)$
> $=\frac{5}{11}$ By the geometric sum rule
> 
> ---
> 
> $P(\omega\text{ is even})=\frac{5}{11}$

## 1.20

We roll a fair die four times.

### a

Describe the sample space $\Omega$ and the probability measure $P$ that model this experiment. To describe $P$, give the value $P(\{\omega\})$ for each outcome $\omega\in\Omega$.

> [!answer]
> Let $\alpha=\{1, 2,\dots, 6\}$
> Let $\Omega=\alpha^{4}$
> 
> $\forall\omega\in\Omega:P(\{\omega\})=\frac{1}{6^{4}}$

### b

Let $A$ be the event that there are at least two fives among the four rolls. Let $B$ be the event that there is at most one five among the four rolls. Find the probabilities $P (A)$ and $P (B)$ by finding the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total, as in Fact 1.8.

> [!answer]
> ![[./1/tables#^2|tables]]
> 
> $P(A)=\frac{171}{1296}$
> $P(B)=\frac{1125}{1296}$
> $\square$

### c

What is the set $A\cup B$? What equality should $P (A)$ and $P (B)$ satisfy? Check that your answers to part (b) satisfy this equality.

> [!answer]
> Since $A$ and $B$ are complementary, $P(A)+P(B)=1$
> 
> $P(A)+P(B)=1$ as checked.
> $\square$

## 1.22

We pick a card uniformly at random from a standard deck of 52 cards. (If you are unfamiliar with the deck of 52 cards, see the description above Example C.19 in Appendix C.)

### a

Describe the sample space $\Omega$ and the probability measure $P$ that model this
experiment.

> [!answer]
> $\Omega=\{\text{Diamonds},\text{Clubs},\text{Hearts},\text{Spades}\}\times\{\text{A},2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,\text{J},\text{Q},\text{K}\}$
> $\forall \omega\in\Omega:P(\{\omega\})=\frac{1}{52}$

### b

Give an example of an event in this probability space with probability $\frac{3}{52}$

> [!answer]
> $P(\omega\in\text{Royal Spades}):\omega\in\Omega$

### c

Show that there is no event in this probability space with probability $\frac{1}{5}$.

> [!answer]
> Since there are $52$ equal probability cards, any subset $A\subset\Omega$ must contain an integer amount of elements less than or equal to 52.
> 
> We may sum over the cards in $A$ as pulling any card is disjoint from pulling any other card.
> $P(A)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}P(\{A_{i}\})\implies P(A)=\frac{|A|}{52}$
> 
> $\frac{1}{5}$ is not a multiple of $\frac{1}{52}$ and thus there cannot exist a set $A$ such that $\frac{|A|}{52}=\frac{1}{5}$.

## 1.34

Pick a uniformly chosen random point inside a unit square (a square of sidelength 1) and draw a circle of radius $1/3$ around the point. Find the probability that the circle lies entirely inside the square.

> [!answer]
> We may divide the square into 9 equal squares, dividing by three vertically and horizontally.
> 
> Any circle centered in the center of the 9 squares will be entirely contained by the square, as the distance to its closest edge is at least $\frac{1}{3}$.
> 
> Any circle not centered on the center of the 9 squares will not be entirely contained, as the distance to the closest edge is less than $\frac{1}{3}$.
> 
> Since the area of each of the sub-squares are the same, they have the same probability of being sampled:
> 
> $\Omega=[\![1,9]\!]$
> $\forall \omega\in\Omega:P(\{\omega\})=\frac{1}{9}$
> 
> $P(\{5\})=\frac{1}{9}$
