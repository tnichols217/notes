## 2.1

We roll two dice. Find the conditional probability that at least one of the numbers is even, given that the sum is 8.



## 2.6

When Alice spends the day with the babysitter, there is a $0.6$ probability that she turns on the TV and watches a show. Her little sister Betty cannot turn the TV on by herself. But once the TV is on, Betty watches with probability $0.8$. Tomorrow the girls spend the day with the babysitter.

Hint. Define events precisely and use the product rule and the law of total probability.

### a

What is the probability that both Alice and Betty watch TV tomorrow?

### b

What is the probability that Betty watches TV tomorrow?

### c

What is the probability that only Alice watches TV tomorrow?
