# What is AI

## The two dimensions of definition

### Human vs rational

Some people would say that we can measure an AI's performance by its similarity to a human's act. This involves more of a empirical science to measure, like phych, whilst the rational approach measures performance based on statistics and math.

### Thought vs behavior

Some people believe that AI would truly be intelligent only if it's behavior is indistinguishable from a human, whilst other people believe that it is truly intelligent if it has a rational thought process with reasoning.

If we follow the human behavior approach, then the process of coming to an answer would not matter as long as the answer is "correct" or "intelligent".

## A deep delve into the four quadrants

### Acting Humanly

- Basically what is defined by the **Turing test**
- If something acts indistinguishable from a human, it must be intelligent
- This requires
  - **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)
  - **Knowledge Representation** and storage
  - **Automated Reasoning**
  - Learning - **Machine Learning** (ML)
- If physical, it also requires
  - **Computer Vision**
  - **Robotics**
- Not a full-proof system, as the goal with flying isn't to "replicate a bird"

### Thinking Humanly

- Must think like and replicate a human's thought process to be intelligent
- To learn about humans this requires
  - **Introspection**
  - **Psychological Experiments**
  - **Brain Imaging**
  - **Cognitive Science**
- This idea of studying the human mind as well as mimicking it in computer intelligence pushes both fields forward

### Thinking Rationally

- The idea that conclusions should be arrived from strongly enforced logic
- Gaps in logic can be inferred with probabilities and statistics
- This allows for rational thought and conclusions, but does not allow for novel or new things, and does not lead to intelligent behavior
- This alone is probably not enough for an AI to seem intelligent to humans

### Acting Rationally

- Rational agents achieve the best logical outcome from inputs
- The idea that AI should act to do the best and right thing objectively
- A good point for analysis as the pinnacle of rationality
- Hard for humans to express to AI the correct values with all its caveats, like drive safely (for who? what is safe? what is comfortable?)

## Practicalities in Intelligence

### Dualities in the philosophy of AI

#### Duality vs Materialism

- Duality: Idea that the human mind possesses something other than just a physical "processor"
- Materialism: The idea that all things are physical on some level and physical interactions are all the govern the mind on some level

#### Utilitarianism vs Consequentialism

- Utilitarianism: Maximizing utility to society as a whole no matter short term costs
- Consequentialism: Make decisions based on direct outcomes of an action

### Logic

- How would this intelligence be calculated
- Is is possible to be computed traditionally?
- How can we verify that the outcomes are valid

### Economics

- What is the worth in AI and is it worth investment
- Will AI be worth more than what is put into it

### Neuroscience and Humans

- How do human brains work and how is this applicable to AI
- Is the brain structure worth replicating for an AI's computations?
- Can AI augment humans through a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)?
- Will AI be able to "outperform" a human?

### Phychology

- How do humans think
- Are computers compatible with this method of reasoning?

### Engineering

- How can such a system be implemented?
- How can this system be optimized?

### Control

- How will an AI be given goals
- How will we ensure goals are communicated well
- Can cost functions account of all positive and negative effects in a model?
- What will be the problems if something is not accounted for in the cost function

### Linguistics and communication

- How does language effect thought
- Does an AI need linguistics to think like a human
- How will AI understand human language

### Risk-Benefit analysis

- Lethal and unethical actions based on poorly communicated goals
- Biased results based on training
- Reduction in human usefulness
- Reliability in safety critical applications
- Is an artificial super-intelligence ethical to create
