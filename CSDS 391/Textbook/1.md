# What is AI
## The two dimensions of definition
### Human vs rational

Some people would say that we can measure an AI's performance by its similarity to a human's act. This involves more of a empirical science to measure, like phych, whilst the rational approach measures performance based on statistics and math.

### Thought vs behavior

Some people believe that AI would truly be intelligent only if it's behavior is indistinguishable from a human, whilst other people believe that it is truly intelligent if it has a rational thought process with reasoning.

If we follow the human behavior approach, then the process of coming to an answer would not matter as long as the answer is "correct" or "intelligent".
