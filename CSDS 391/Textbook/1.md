# What is AI
## The two dimensions of definition
### Human vs rational



### Thought vs behavior

Some people believe that AI would truly be intelligent only if it acts indistinguishable from a human, whilst other people believe that it is truly intelligent if it has a rational thought process with reasoning.

If we follow the human behavior approach, then the process of coming to an answer would not matter as long as the answer is "correct" or "intelligent"
