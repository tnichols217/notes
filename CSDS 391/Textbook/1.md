# What is AI
## The two dimensions of definition
### Human vs rational

Some people would say that we can measure an AI's performance by its similarity to a human's act. This involves more of a empirical science to measure, like phych, whilst the rational approach measures performance based on statistics and math.

### Thought vs behavior

Some people believe that AI would truly be intelligent only if it's behavior is indistinguishable from a human, whilst other people believe that it is truly intelligent if it has a rational thought process with reasoning.

If we follow the human behavior approach, then the process of coming to an answer would not matter as long as the answer is "correct" or "intelligent".

## A deep delve into the four quadrants

### Acting Humanly

- Basically what is defined by the **Turing test**
- If something acts indistinguishable from a human, it must be intelligent
- This requires
	- **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)
	- **Knowledge Representation** and storage
	- **Automated Reasoning**
	- Learning - **Machine Learning** (ML)
- If physical, it also requires
	- **Computer Vision**
	- **Robotics**
- Not a full-proof system, as the goal with flying isn't to "replicate a bird"

### Thinking Humanly

- Must think like and replicate a human's thought process to be intelligent
- To learn about humans this requires
	- **Introspection**
	- **Psychological Experiments**
	- **Brain Imaging**
	- **Cognitive Science**
