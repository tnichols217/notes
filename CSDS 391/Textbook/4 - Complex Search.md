# Complex Search

- Some problems just require finding the goal state
- The path to get there does not matter
- This applies to optimization problems and can be solved with local search

## Local Search

> [!def]
> **Local Search**
> An algorithm that operates only on the current state and a target goal state

- Is not systematic, may never explore some areas
- May explore previously visited areas
- Much lower memory cost, more efficient for huge data sets
- Can find a reasonable solution in big sets of data

## Optimization Problem
