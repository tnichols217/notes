# Types of Searches

## Uninformed Search

Depth First: Keep going until cannot, then swap children
Breadth First: Expand all children of the closest node
Best-first: Expand the node closest to the result
Uniform-cost: Expand closest node accounting for node distance
Depth limited: Depth first up to a limit
Bidirectional: Start from beginning and end and meet in the middle

## Informed Search

Greedy Best-first: Expand the closest node
A\*: Expand the smallest heuristic + distance to start
Weighted A\*: Multiply heu
