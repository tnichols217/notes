## Game Theory

### Stances on Multi Agent Environments
#### The Economy

Consider all other agents as part of an economy, and predict and respond to the general movement instead of individual agents

- Much more effective for large number of agents

#### The Environment

Consider all other agents as part of an unpredictable environment and just respond based on their response

- Hard to distinguish useful from useless information, like an upper cut from an enemy or just the rain

#### The Model

Model the adversarial agents in order to predict and beat their movements

- Much more computationally expensive
- Much more accurate

### Types of Multi Agent Games

#### Information

##### Perfect Information

- All agents can see the entire state of the game
- Much easier to predict and calculate the future of the game

##### Partial Observable

- Agents cannot see the entire state of the game, often only what relates to them directly
- Harder to predict future moves as there is high uncertainty in the game state
