# Quantifying Uncertainty

## Belief States

> [!def]
> **Belief State**
> A representation of all possible world states with likelihoods for all of them

- Expensive to compute
- Only likely to be used for small systems

## Decision Making

- Sometimes there is no "correct" answer or path
- Sometimes there is a **qualification problem** where there are factors hard to explain
- Decisions must still be made by the system based on rationality

## Summarizing Uncertainty

> [!def]
> **Probability Theory**
> A way to represent likelihoods of current states from a limited amount of information about the environment

- Explaining an effect from a list of causes can also be impossible
	- Must be represented with rules of uncertainty
	- Failure to correctly identify an effect could stem from
		- Laziness
		- Theoretical Ignorance
		- Practical Ignorance
- **Degrees of belief** must be used to represent likely effects from causes using probability theory

## Rational Decisions

> [!def]
> **Utility Theory**
> A way to represent preferences based on their **relative** usefulness to each other.
> ---
> **Decision Theory**
> Probability Theory + Utility Theory

- Rational Decisions are ones use the **Maximum expected utility** of a state.

## Probability Lingo

> [!def]
> **Marginal Probability**
> Probability of a particular trait across all possible other trait combination
