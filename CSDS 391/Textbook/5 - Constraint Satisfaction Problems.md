## Components of a CSP

Variables could be as simple 
Simple CSPs could have discrete finite valid values for variables, whilst complex ones may have continuous, infinite valid values



## Constraint Graphs

Often it is useful to construct a graph where each edge marks the continuum between the extremities of a constraint

This way a search procedure could be evaluated upon the graph to find a complete assignment
