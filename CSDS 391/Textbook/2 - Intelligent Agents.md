# Intelligent Agents

An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment (through sensors) and act upon it (through actuators)

- **Percept sequences** is the history of perception of an agent
- **Agent function** is what maps percept sequences into actions
- **Tabulating** is putting inputs and outputs of an agent into a table

## Training an AI

- AI is often trained and rewarded in a consequentialist nature, only training on the final output
- Make sure that you reward and punish an AI on what you **want the result to be** and not what you **want the AI to do**

## Rationality

- For an AI, depends on
	- Measurement of success
	- Knowledge of environment
	- Available actions
	- Percept sequence
- The agent should select the best option based on the percept sequence and environment to maximize success
- Balancing is important, especially to ensure that the AI does not avoid perceiving dangers to reduce punishment
- **Autonomy** is using **percept sequences to modify actions** that would be based on prior knowledge otherwise

## Task Environment

The world that the AI lives in, consisting of the inputs, outputs, and modifiable objects

- Performance
- Environment
- Actuators
- Sensor
