# Intelligent Agents

An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment (through sensors) and act upon it (through actuators)

- **Percept sequences** is the history of perception of an agent
- **Agent function** is what maps percept sequences into actions
- **Tabulating** is putting inputs and outputs of an agent into a table

## Training an AI

- AI is often trained and rewarded in a consequentialist nature, only training on the final output
- Make sure that you reward and punish an AI on what you **want the result to be** and not what you **want the AI to do**

## Rationality

- For an AI, depends on
  - Measurement of success
  - Knowledge of environment
  - Available actions
  - Percept sequence
- The agent should select the best option based on the percept sequence and environment to maximize success
- Balancing is important, especially to ensure that the AI does not avoid perceiving dangers to reduce punishment
- **Autonomy** is using **percept sequences to modify actions** that would be based on prior knowledge otherwise

## Task Environment

The world that the AI lives in, consisting of the inputs, outputs, and modifiable objects

- Performance
- Environment
  - Multi-agency
    - Single-agent: does not need to interact with other agents or intelligent beings
    - Multi-agent: needs to interact and learn from other agents
  - Dynamic
    - Dynamic: Environment changes even without influence from the agent
    - Static: Environment does not change without the agent's actuation
  - Discretion
    - Discrete: defined time steps and action phases
    - Continuous: constantly acting and acting upon sensors
- Actuators
  - Determinism
    - Deterministic: New state of environment after actuation completely depends on the action
    - Nondeterministic (stochastic): New state of environment after actuation is influenced but not defined by the action
- Sensors
  - Observational
    - Fully observable: knows the entire environment
    - Partially observable: knows limited information about the environment
  - Known
    - Known: understanding the environment based on sensor data
    - Unknown: not having been trained in such an environment before

## Types of agents

### Simple Reflex

- Ignores percept history and acts on current inputs
- Much less data needed to be processed
- Follows simple condition-action rules
- Highly unstable and uninformed
- Sometimes needs a little randomization to break out of an infinite feedback loop

### Model-based Reflex

- Build a memory of the environment (**transition model**)
- Update environment changes
- **Sensor model** is learning how sensors interact differently in different environments
- A little more data, but also more informed about the environment

### Goal-based

- More relaxed on the method and focuses on the outcome
- More flexible
- Can be difficult to bridge the gap from beginning to reaching the goal

### Utility-based

- A performance standard is defined for the model
- A predictive utility function is internalized to the model
- The agent aims to maximize its expected utility
- More predictable and rational than goal-based

### Learning

- Broken down into
	- Learning element
	- Performance element
	- Problem generator
	- Critic
- Feedback improves the learning element to maximize the critic's output
- The problem generator explores unknown situations

## Representations of agents

### Atomic Representation

- Changes are atomic and indivisible
- No internal structure to separate inputs

### Factored Representation

- Describes each state with variables and attributes
-
