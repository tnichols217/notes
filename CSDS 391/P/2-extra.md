# Multi Layer Networks

Similar to a single layer (0 hidden layers) network, a multi-layer network attempts to create a network such that when an input is passed through, it can accurately predict the output.

When before with a single layer network, each output would be the sum of weights multiplied by every characteristic (input) plus a bias. This number will then be fed through a non-linearity. Whilst
