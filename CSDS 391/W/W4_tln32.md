$P(x=i\cup y=j)=\begin{bmatrix}0.06&0.08&0.04&0.02\\0.12&0.16&0.08&0.04\\0.09&0.12&0.06&0.03\\0.03&0.04&0.02&0.01\end{bmatrix}_{(j,i)}$

If this were a valid probability distribution, then the sum of the probabilities of all possible samples will add up to $1$.

$0.06+0.08+0.04+0.02+0.12+0.16+0.08+0.04+0.09+0.12+0.06+0.03+0.03+0.04+0.02+0.01=$
