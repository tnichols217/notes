## a

Let $M=\begin{bmatrix}0.06&0.08&0.04&0.02\\0.12&0.16&0.08&0.04\\0.09&0.12&0.06&0.03\\0.03&0.04&0.02&0.01\end{bmatrix}$

Then $P(x=i\cup y=j)=M_{(j,i)}$

If this were a valid probability distribution, then the sum of the probabilities of all possible samples will add up to $1$.

$0.06+0.08+0.04+0.02+$
$0.12+0.16+0.08+0.04+$
$0.09+0.12+0.06+0.03+$
$0.03+0.04+0.02+0.01$
$=1$

Therefore, this is a valid probability distribution

## b

Let $\vec A=\begin{bmatrix}0.2\\0.4\\0.3\\0.1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec B=\begin{bmatrix}0.3&0.4&0.2&0.1\end{bmatrix}$

Such that $M=\vec A\vec B$

The probability of getting a particular $x$ would be equal to $\sum$
